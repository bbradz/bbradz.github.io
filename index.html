          I use this website to share my thoughts on topics spanning machine
          learning, artificial intelligence, economics, infrastructure, and
          policy. The views expressed here are entirely my own, they do not
          reflect those of any employer.

        <p style="color: var(--text-color);"><b>The Elevator Pitch...</b></p>
        <p>
          I am a third-year undergraduate at Brown University, majoring in
          Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I'm involved with
          research in Brown's Physics Department exploring applications of
          reinforcement learning to navigation in gravitational environments and
          symbolic regression for scientific discovery under the guidance of
          Professors Gaitskell and Gouskos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond academics, I manage Business and International Travel for The
          Brown Derbies, Brown’s oldest continuous tenor-bass a cappella group.
          I am also an active member of the Brown Debate Union (BDU), the Brown
          AI Safety Team (BAIST), the Brown Forecasting Club (BFC), and the
          Brown Investment Group (BIG).
        </p>
        <p>
          A defining feature, I think, of my personality is the need for ambitious, 
          self-organizing goals—- projects demanding sustained effort over medium to 
          long periods of time which sort my time into a clear sense of direction. 
          Whether it's that time I logged everything I did in 30-minute intervals 
          for just over a year, building this website, conducting research, or planning 
          tours for my a cappella group, these goals act as a guiding star. 
          Without them, life feels disjointed, even chaotic. I imagine many 
          people can relate to this but I can't help feel like it's particularly 
          pronounced in my mode of operating.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recognize that I often fail to fully appreciate the everyday beauty 
          of existence and take for granted the incredible people, experiences, 
          and surroundings that enrich my life because of that focus. I strive 
          to nurture those meaningful connections to my world while feeding my
          internal need for <i>min-max</i>'ing towards my life goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Viktor E. Frankl famously observed:
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 16px !important; text-align: center;">
          <i>“Those who have a ‘why’ to live, can bear with almost any ‘how.’”</i>
        </p>

        <!-- Cognitive Assessment Tables -->
        <h2 id="cognitive-assessment" style="margin-bottom: 16px !important;">The Big Guns― A Psychological Profiling</h2>

        <p>The following are the results of a Neuropsychological Assessment I participated in on 
          December 7th, 2024. The test composed of differing tools for assessing cognitive ability, 
          attention, executive function, verbal skills, and personality. I figure this may be the 
          best source I have to express my strengths & weaknesses neuropsychologically; Turning it 
          over to the experts. So, in the spirit of radical openness, enjoy my test results. The 
          following are the list of specific tests which I have results for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>WAIS-5</strong>: Tasks include recalling sequences, solving puzzles, and defining words.</li>
          <li><strong>CPT-3</strong>: Press a button when a specific letter appears on a screen and avoid pressing for others.</li>
          <li><strong>D-KEFS</strong>: Includes tasks like switching between numbers and letters or tracing patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>RCFT</strong>: Copying a complex figure and later reproducing it from memory.</li>
          <li><strong>PAI, BAI, BDI</strong>: Responding to questions about mood, personality, and anxiety levels.</li>
          <li><strong>ADOS-2</strong>: Responding to structured prompts to evaluate social and communication behaviors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I should reiterate before presenting this that I happen to think we're actually
          extremely bad at measuring the complexities of different human minds and the 
          different types of behavior which different people have learned in order to survive 
          and thrive in their particular place in the world. While there may be a sort of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)"><i>g factor</i></a>
          across minds significant enough to measure on any particular suite of tasks 
          I find it extremely hard to believe that it's worthwhile to discuss or matters for 
          practical purposes of explaining outcomes. When looking at numbers like this 
          it's important to consider the vast sea of orthogonal aspects of life which it 
          fails to encapsulate and vastly different life experiences and life structure I have
          fallen into. For example, how am I at cooking? The answer: Not Good! But
          that being said I feel like it's more useful as a measure of personality than 
          Astrology! Haha, i joke i joke, read ahead---

      <p>
        Maybe another way to express some triangulation of my particular personality 
        would be to highlight the particularly relevant individuals who've deeply 
        influenced my thinking and whom I turn to for so much of the 
        information I consume on a regular basis. Each of these figures has 
        captured my attention over time in their own way, producing content 
        that repeatedly captures my interest to shape the way I think and view 
        the world.

          <li><strong>CGP Grey</strong>: Known for extremely high quality educational 
            YouTube videos, I fell in love with CGP Grey's content through his podcast
            <i>Hello Internet</i> and later more minorly <i>Cortex</i> where he delves 
            in more detail into topics in the systems of politics, transportation, 
            technology, socialization, and the mimetic warfare of the modern internet.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Ezra Klein</strong>: Journalist and author, Ezra Klein 
            works at the intersection of politics & policy through his writing and podcast.
            Ezra promotes a vision of American Liberal Democracy as fundamentally flawed 
            but worth working to improve through the YIMBY movement, Supply-Side Progressivism, 
            Party Politics, and the notorious <i>Abundance Agenda</i>.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Destiny</strong>: Originally a Starcraft Pro player, Destiny 
            (Steven Bonelli by name) earned his chops as a debater & streamer ruthlessly 
            breaking down radical populist arguments from the many corners of the internet
            into their absurdities and merits. Destiny frequents in philosophical logical
            grounding while remaining tuned into the goings on in Popular Internet Culture.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Dylan Patel</strong>: Chief Analyst of semiconductor industry analysis 
            firm SemiAnalysis, Dylan brings regular deep & exciting insights which connect 
            abstract large scale market trends to the particulars of algorithmic and hardware 
            advancements alongside best-in-class coverage of exact movements among FAANG actors
            and geopolitical actors moving the field forward.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Alex O'Connor</strong>: Originally named <i>Cosmic Skeptic</i>,
            Alex gives various issues of deep philosophical importance in theology, 
            ethics, and metaphysics their due through the classic subdued contemplation 
            of a reddit denizen turned Cambridge schoolboy.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Francois Chollet</strong>: AI researcher, engineer to the Keras deep 
          learning software library, and the mind behind the infamous ARC-AGI benchmark, 
          Francois provides absolutely invaluable systems-level descriptions of the limitations &
          strengths of our current AI models. Francois strips back the fever-pitch of hype in
          the media to reveal a sobering view where generalization, abstraction, and the many 
          aspects of reasoning which cannot simply be expressed through a loss curve 
          reign supreme.</li>

        It would also probably be informative to describe myself as a child of divorce who 
        grew up as the middle child in an all-female house. Interpret whatever psychoanalysis
        you personally want from that fact about myself because I know I can definitely
        try to but it feels relevant to mention as an influence on me relevant in
        determining my particular personality.
