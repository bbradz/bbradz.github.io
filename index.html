          I use this website to share my thoughts on topics spanning machine
          learning, artificial intelligence, economics, infrastructure, and
          policy. The views expressed here are entirely my own, they do not
          reflect those of any employer.

        <p style="color: var(--text-color);"><b>The Boiler Pitch...</b></p>
        <p>
          I am a full-time third-year student at Brown University, majoring in
          Computer Science and Applied Mathematics where I'm involved in
          research with the Physics Department exploring applications of
          reinforcement learning to navigation in gravitational environments and
          symbolic regression for scientific discovery under the guidance of
          Professors Gaitskell and Gouskos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond academics, I manage Business and International Travel for The
          Brown Derbies, Brown’s oldest continuous tenor-bass a cappella group.
          I am also an active member of the Brown Debate Union (BDU), the Brown
          AI Safety Team (BAIST), the Brown Forecasting Club (BFC), and the
          Brown Investment Group (BIG).
        </p>
        <p>
          A defining feature, I think, of my personality is the need for ambitious, 
          self-organizing goals—- projects demanding sustained effort over medium to 
          long periods of time which sort my time into a clear sense of direction. 
          Whether it's that time I logged everything I did in 30-minute intervals 
          for just over a year, building this website, conducting research, or planning 
          tours for my a cappella group, these goals act as a guiding star. 
          Without them, life feels disjointed, even chaotic. I imagine many 
          people can relate to this but I can't help feel like it's particularly 
          pronounced in my way operating.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recognize that I often fail to fully appreciate the everyday beauty 
          of existence and take for granted the incredible people, experiences, 
          and surroundings that enrich my life because of that focus. I strive 
          to nurture those meaningful connections to my world while feeding my
          internal need for <i>min-max</i>'ing towards these necessary life goals.

        <!-- Cognitive Assessment Tables -->
        <h2 id="cognitive-assessment" style="margin-bottom: 16px !important;">Cognitive Assessment Summary</h2>

        <p>The following are the results of a Neuropsychological Assessment I participated in on 
          December 7th, 2024. The test composed of differing tools for assessing cognitive ability, 
          attention, executive function, verbal skills, and personality. I figure this may be the 
          best way I express my strengths & weakness, turning it over to the experts, so in the 
          spirit of rafical openness enjoy my test results. The following are the list of specific
          tests which I have results for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>WAIS-5</strong>: Tasks include recalling sequences, solving puzzles, and defining words.</li>
          <li><strong>CPT-3</strong>: Press a button when a specific letter appears on a screen and avoid pressing for others.</li>
          <li><strong>D-KEFS</strong>: Includes tasks like switching between numbers and letters or tracing patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>RCFT</strong>: Copying a complex figure and later reproducing it from memory.</li>
          <li><strong>PAI, BAI, BDI</strong>: Responding to questions about mood, personality, and anxiety levels.</li>
          <li><strong>ADOS-2</strong>: Responding to structured prompts to evaluate social and communication behaviors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I should reiterate before presenting this that I happen to think we're actually
          extremely bad at measuring the complexities of different human minds and the 
          different types of behavior which different people have learned in order to survive 
          and thrive in their particular place in the world. When looking at numbers like this 
          it's important to consider the vast sea of orthogonal aspects of life which it 
          fails to encapsulate, that being said I feel like it's more useful as a measure of 
          personality than Astrology! Haha. I joke. Read ahead.
