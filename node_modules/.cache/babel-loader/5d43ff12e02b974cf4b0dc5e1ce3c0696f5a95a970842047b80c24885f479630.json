Message</h2>\n        <p>\n          Four weeks ago, the American people went to the polls and voted to\n          remove the Biden administration, returning Donald Trump to the Oval\n          Office and the position of Commander in Chief. This has been the most\n          consequential and upsetting election result of my lifetime.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In the wake of this <u>disaster</u>, the atmosphere feels markedly\n          different from that of 2016. Back then, fiery reactions of resistance\n          and horror erupted from the liberal masses. Now, however, the response\n          is <i>very</i> different. I'm seeing a transformation within the\n          liberal intelligentsia-- a shift toward <i>depressive</i> self-doubt.\n          Vibrant democratic thought withdraws amidst its defeat, conceding its\n          rejection by the American people in favor of the MAGA movement. We try\n          to grapple with the immense question of how to craft a constructive\n          narrative of the American dream that can reconcile our understanding\n          of ourselves and the failures which lead to this man's re-election by\n          the popular majority.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Why, how, could they have preferred that man after everything the\n          Biden Administration had done? More importantly, should this be taken\n          as a fundamental rejection of the ability of the way of governing\n          Biden represented to survive politically—is Trumpist politics and\n          illiberalism the superior model, or is there some way to articulate\n          within the language of Liberalism a path forward?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We are witnessing sparks of a long-overdue intellectual attempt to\n          locate, describe, and overcome whatever leads 10s of millions to\n          reject liberal America and turn to a man like that. A repudiation of\n          Bidenomics and the Democratic coalition's agenda in its entirety, this\n          time, by the democratic will.\n        </p>\n        <p>And I'm here to answer those questions :</p>\n        <p>\n          <i>Just kidding,,, 💢❗️</i>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          But I'd at the very least like to discuss those questions a bit in\n          this public space for venting.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"/assets/pics/cost-of-living.png\"\n            alt=\"Cost of Living\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-med\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          Amidst the tension, I feel that some of the strongest arguments\n          explaining why the Democrats were so thoroughly rejected boil down to\n          issues of macroeconomic reality. The arguments generally proceed as\n          follows: A whipsaw of society reopening after COVID-19, brittle\n          globalized supply chains, and built-up consumer savings gluts caused\n          trillions of dollars to flood into a restricted supply pool. This\n          surge led to inflation spiking and price levels increasing by some\n          <a\n            href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/latest-inflation-statistics/\"\n            style={{ color: \"inherit\", textDecoration: \"underline\" }}\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            20 percent since 2020\n          </a>\n          . Such unprecedented rises in price levels have inspired fury among\n          voters across the board in one of the most election-dense years in\n          human history. Universally leading to voters having elected to throw\n          out their ruling parties, pointing the finger at them for the real\n          pain of these economic conditions.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I should express now, before beginning to build my narrative, the\n          great postmodern caveat that I am aware and in large part preoccupied\n          with how there are important aspects of how this election played out\n          which this narrative overlooks. The media environment and the failure\n          to conduct a proper presidential primary process are, in my mind, the\n          primary missing pieces. <i>Nonetheless</i>, I think the overall\n          narrative is correct up to a point.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I don't think this is solely about COVID-19 😷. I think the pandemic\n          was the catalyst that revealed a cost-of-living crisis arising from an\n          intersection of failures within liberal institutions that have been\n          left unaddressed for quite some time now. The veneer of a\n          decade-and-a-half long, globalization-induced zero-inflation landscape\n          has been cast off. The American people are seeing the direction in\n          which society is moving in liberal America and have recognized the\n          need for change. I happen to agree, and I believe there are some\n          compelling reasons to do so.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Liberal America is failing to understand <u>economic reality</u> and\n          the experiences of real economic anxiety at front of mind for the\n          American people. In order to explain this I felt it would be an\n          interesting exercise to explore the history behind how we arrived at\n          the development of the mainstream economic schools of today as well as\n          some of the more iconoclastic schools that have been gaining traction\n          outside the halls of academia, one of which I happen to give a whole\n          lot of stock in as explaining how the economy has expanded in\n          complexity beyond what our archaic models properly captured. Trying to\n          articulate\n          <b>with theory</b>\n          the ghost in the machine pointing all our indicators of how we would\n          project the American people to be perceiving their economic well-being\n          off from reality.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 id=\"B\">Stepping Through...</h2>\n        <p>\n          The very first theory of economics was ✨Adam Smith✨'s school of\n          Classical Economics, also known as laissez-faire economics. Under this\n          framework, markets were seen as self-regulating through the invisible\n          hand of self-interest, and government was advised to take as minimal a\n          role in the economy as possible.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Classical Economics dominated academic thought up until the Great\n          Depression, which seemed to prove that free markets could, in fact, in\n          and of themselves bring about truly deep and prolonged dysfunction.\n          Dynamics of extended mass unemployment and fears of economic\n          stagnation began to boil over. In response, the ideas of Keynesianism\n          rose alongside the guns of a big New Deal American government, which\n          endorsed and seemed to validate its ideas.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Under the Keynesian School of Economics, it was argued that the\n          government should be the rational actor to <i>smooth</i> over the\n          highs and lows of business cycles. This meant the government providing\n          active support to the economy in times of economic breakdown and\n          saving, cooling the economy, in times of sustained economic growth.\n          Keynesians didn't necessarily argue against the long-term wisdom of\n          the invisible hand of the free market, but they rebuked it with the\n          now-famous assertion that \"in the long run, we are all dead.\" They\n          contended that the government cannot let people live in squalor today\n          for the sake of a not obviously forthcoming well-off future. Short-run\n          failures of the market needed to be righted to put the economy back on\n          track in the short term.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The government, as an economic actor itself, could step in when\n          aggregate demand collapsed. As the sole holder of rights to print\n          money, it could create money to spend in the economy and bring\n          economic activity back up to healthy levels. Keynesianism aligned\n          itself with a revision of Classical Economics known as Neoclassical\n          Economics, which incorporated new theoretical progress in rational\n          choice theory. This highlighted the importance of government in\n          controlling economic agents' expectations through policy posturing,\n          which would influence the state of things going forward and encourage\n          differing views of the future that impact current behavior. Together,\n          Keynesian and Neoclassical tools of supply and demand formed what is\n          known as the Neoclassical Synthesis.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Unfortunately, come the 1970s, in an America with the Great Depression\n          far in its rearview mirror, a new economic syndrome began to show its\n          face—one which Keynesianism proved unable to address. This spawned yet\n          another new era of economic thought: Monetarism, as well as a splinter\n          faction in the form of the Austrian School of Economics.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"/assets/pics/invisible_hand.webp\"\n            alt=\"Invisible Hand\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-small\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          Going into the 1970s, the U.S. government was already stimulating the\n          economy heavily due to poor rates of productivity increases. Then,\n          OPEC—the cartel of oil-producing countries—embargoed the United\n          States, causing inflation to skyrocket. An inflationary cycle took\n          place where workers demanded higher wages to keep up with inflation,\n          and in return, businesses passed the increased labor costs onto\n          consumers, creating a self-reinforcing spiral. Economic growth was\n          low, and inflation was high, directly challenging Keynesianism's call\n          for stimulus in times of inflation.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The government could not stimulate its way out of the chaos, in fact,\n          in some ways it had stimulated its way <i>into</i> the chaos. This\n          called into question whether even the government could be seen to be\n          able to know when to prudently cut back versus stimulate in the\n          national economy.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A crisis into which the Monetarist school rose with a theory centered\n          around the supply of money and an increased importance of the Federal\n          Reserve in regulating the national economy. Under the Monetarist\n          framework, the money supply was the unifying pool into which all\n          levers of government fed to control the economy. The Federal Reserve,\n          as the sole institution empowered to print U.S. dollars, became the\n          most important economic actor in town outside Congress.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <iframe\n            width=\"800\"\n            height=\"450\"\n            src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zxwO4xw4CZ0?start=167\"\n            title=\"The Fed's Great Inflation Mystery\"\n            frameBorder=\"0\"\n            allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n            allowFullScreen\n            referrerPolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n          ></iframe>\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          Monetarists maintained the theory of economic cycles from Keynesianism\n          and built upon it, rearticulating a vision for how the government\n          could more directly measure the health of the economy and a lever to\n          pull for increasing or decreasing stimulation of the economy to\n          counteract the business cycles. Monetarists argued, convincingly, that\n          inflation is the product of the supply of money growing faster than\n          the bucket of real economic output being purchased with that money.\n          They described inflation mathematically under the formula:\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <MathJax inline>{`MV = PQ`}</MathJax>, where{\" \"}\n          <MathJax inline>{`M`}</MathJax> is the money supply,{\" \"}\n          <MathJax inline>{`V`}</MathJax> is the velocity of money,{\" \"}\n          <MathJax inline>{`P`}</MathJax> is the price level, and{\" \"}\n          <MathJax inline>{`Q`}</MathJax> is real output. Monetarists argued\n          that the Federal Reserve could reduce inflation through tools\n          explicitly designed to decrease the amount of money flowing through\n          the economy.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A natural rate of unemployment was defined, and a correlation\n          established between the money supply and the inflation consumers were\n          experiencing in front of their eyes. Alongside a new, strict, Federal\n          Reserve chairmanship under Paul Volcker—who subscribed to this new\n          Monetarist school—he spiked interest rates to cool down economic\n          activity, causing not only the recession of the early 1980s but also\n          the successful curtailment of the inflation spiral that the school had\n          risen to address.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Simultaneously, guided by desires to counteract the Cold War\n          tendencies toward central planning—which existed in the USSR at the\n          time and were seen by many in the Monetarist school—the Austrian\n          School of Economics grew. It rejected this activist Federal Reserve,\n          pointing the finger at the government's attempts to smooth out the\n          business cycle as the exact source of the economic cycles of booms and\n          busts it was trying to solve in the first place. The Austrian School\n          took issue with the entire project of Monetarism by arguing that its\n          attempt to treat the money supply as something controllable by\n          government policy was an inherently flawed departure from the tie that\n          currency should have to the physical commodities to which they had\n          historically been pegged (such as the gold standard). Arguing that the\n          government destroys coordination in the economy when it meddles with\n          that ratio & signal of economic reality.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Austrian Economics supported deregulation of the banking sector and\n          minimalist monetary intervention, describing business cycles as\n          natural phenomena where government intervention only serves to prolong\n          economic problems that represent the working through of market\n          adjustments.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This combined into the neoliberal equilibrium of\n          <b>Supply-Side Economics</b>. While the Federal Reserve would manage\n          monetary policy—the supply of money—the rest of the government was\n          handling fiscal policy. Arguments that economic activity was being\n          stymied by excessive taxation began to dominate. Taxes were slashed as\n          well as the social policies they funded in favor of the belief that\n          businesses would use the extra money to invest efficiently into\n          boosting economic output. Case in point the infamous Laffer Curve.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"/assets/pics/laffer.webp\"\n            alt=\"Laffer Curve\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-med\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          This is the point at which the modern rejections of economics as a\n          field in its entirety, which I see everywhere around me—both at my\n          university and among my generation as a whole—I believe owe their\n          roots. But it wasn't until the financial crisis of 2008 that these\n          misunderstandings truly came to light.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The financial crisis of 2008 highlighted that there was more to\n          economic collapse than mismanagement of the supply of money.\n          Supply-Side Economics had deregulated its way into a situation where a\n          few systemically important banks took on excessive internal leverage,\n          engaged in risky lending, and indulged in greed-fueled speculation to\n          manufacture imaginary bubbles of economic growth detached from reality\n          and bound to eventually pop. Economic thought began to understand that\n          certain private organizations had grown to become\n          <b>\"too big to fail\"</b>, and that neither the Monetarist school had\n          the conceptual tools to tackle the shortfalls of financial\n          mismanagement nor could the Austrian method of letting the free market\n          fail be allowed to drag the global economy into its greatest crisis\n          since the Great Depression.\n        </p>\n        <p>The old Keynesian adage that...</p>\n        <p className=\"old-timey\">\"In the long run, we are all dead\"</p>\n        <p>\n          was not as dead as the Austrian School may have wished, and something\n          needed to be done to prevent the market from walking itself into a\n          crisis like this again.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Out of this grew entirely new fields of economics. One was\n          <i>Behavioral Economics</i>, which analyzed the psychological dynamics\n          behind how humans act irrationally and how that translates into\n          unhealthy market equilibriums and financial bubbles. Another was\n          <i>Post-Keynesian Theory</i>, which built on Hyman Minsky's Financial\n          Instability Hypothesis to describe how stability breeds instability\n          through increased risk-taking in financial markets. This emphasized\n          the role of financial markets in influencing the supply of money as\n          the source of credit within the economy, essentially providing a\n          synthesis of the Monetarist and Austrian schools of thought.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Post-Keynesianism subsumed Monetarism as the theoretical grounding for\n          its endogenous money supply while articulating new tools for measuring\n          the financial industry as a source of an exogenous money multiplier.\n          In the decade and a half after 2008, during which I was growing up, we\n          saw a process of globalization that caused wage growth to slow and\n          prices to fall as supply chains became more efficient. This efficiency\n          was achieved by utilizing global competitive advantages and economies\n          of scale alongside digitalization, which reduced costs across the\n          economy through efficiencies and better information for consumer\n          goods. Aging demographics also slowed consumer spending.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"/assets/pics/federal_funds.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Federal Funds\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-large\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          This translated into job loss and extremely low levels of inflation,\n          which the Federal Reserve managed through a 15-year regime of\n          near-zero interest rates. It wasn't until the storm of reopening after\n          COVID-19— where globalized supply chains proved far more difficult to\n          logistically restart and trillions flowed back into the market—that\n          the Federal Reserve actually had to pivot to controlling inflation.\n          While experts would tell you that they have largely done a good job at\n          this—with inflation back down and unemployment actually below what\n          Monetarist underpinnings tell us it should be—people had also\n          forgotten what it feels like to see inflation and responded with fury.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 id=\"C\">Debugging 🐞</h2>\n        <p>\n          Much like in the 1980s and 2008, I see two main new schools of\n          heterodox economic thought that have been evolving under the surface\n          of the current establishment of economic theory. I don't necessarily\n          agree with these theories—the first one I'll introduce I'm even fairly\n          sure is very wrong—but I think they're both interesting as a way to\n          dig into some of the freshest ground where issues are being raised\n          with the current way of doing economic thought.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The first theory I would mention is <i>Modern Monetary Theory</i>{\" \"}\n          (MMT). While Austrian Economics critiqued the Monetarist school by\n          arguing against the idea of governments' ability to institute fiat\n          currency— claiming that the value of money is based on the physical\n          commodity to which it is tied—Modern Monetary Theory builds on the\n          chartalist view of money. Chartalism describes the value of money as\n          arising not from some pegging to a physical commodity of specific\n          value but instead from the exclusive right of the government to levy\n          taxes on economic activity. This legitimizes that country's currency\n          as the exclusive medium for valuing all of the economic activity\n          within its borders.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Chartalism shows its fingerprints in much of early economics, from\n          Adam Smith and Jean-Baptiste Say to John Stuart Mill and even Karl\n          Marx. Today, MMT has risen back to popularity largely as a\n          justification for raising taxation to fund government expansion.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Modern Monetary Theory claims that the primary path to full employment\n          is through fiscal policy rather than monetary policy, which is the\n          mainstream narrative. It describes the federal government as breathing\n          value into its currency, where fiscal spending is limited solely by\n          inflation that happens when real resources are being fully utilized—\n          that is, near full employment. MMT rose to prominence in the modern\n          era through shout-outs by politicians like Bernie Sanders and\n          Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It has played a role in delegitimizing fears\n          of taking on debt denominated in one's own government's currency,\n          promoting fiscal spending, and pushing for active federal programs to\n          encourage or directly provide employment.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The primary critique of MMT lies in its overemphasis of the power of\n          the sovereign over its own currency—a point any ForEx trader would\n          readily point out to you. Not only do the values of currencies move\n          based on demand for that currency in international transactions or\n          because of central bank rate arbitrage opportunities, but borrowers\n          largely depend on the stable value of currency in order to loan in\n          that currency. Anti-MMT critiques argue that undercutting this dynamic\n          threatens credit issuance across the economy, which dampens overall\n          economic activity and investment.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Another critique of MMT is that it may be better to put non-elected\n          officials in charge of handling macroeconomic fluctuations rather than\n          elected politicians, who are in many ways encouraged to overheat the\n          economy to win short-term electoral victories. The federal government\n          today, after all, does not seem like the greatest example of a\n          long-term sustainable policy setup.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This brings me to the second heterodox economic theory, about which I\n          dedicate many more words and which I think is very much worth\n          discussing: <i>Neo-Monetarist Economics</i>.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <iframe\n            width=\"800\"\n            height=\"450\"\n            src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yWkeFP08Nh4\"\n            title=\"The New Monetary Economics | The Marginal Revolution Podcast\"\n            frameBorder=\"0\"\n            allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n            allowFullScreen\n            referrerPolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n          ></iframe>\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          Neo-Monetarism grows out of the finance crowd and the economic ideas\n          of\n          <b>Fisher Black</b>—one of the creators of the Black-Scholes model for\n          financial markets containing derivative investment instruments—and\n          <b>Eugene Fama</b>, an expert on modern portfolio management theory.\n          Much like how Post-Keynesianism incorporated financial markets as an\n          exogenous supply outside the direct endogenous M2 money supply,\n          Neo-Monetarism claims that the \"supply of money\" needs to be\n          reimagined. It envisions the economy exactly as you would imagine from\n          a theorist grounded in finance—a system fundamentally built on stocks\n          of wealth, assets of different forms and different liquidity being\n          traded around, often with money as the intermediate step of\n          transaction.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In the eyes of Neo-Monetarists, while money is <i>useful</i>, the core\n          driver of the growth of stocks of wealth and the amount of credit\n          being issued from those stocks is the <b>liquidity</b> of a huge swath\n          of asset classes with varying <b>returns</b>. Thus, the supply of\n          money becomes some measure of the size of the total assets being\n          traded, adjusted for the liquidity of each of those assets. Debt and\n          equity become not mere additions and subtractions from the size of the\n          economy but, as beautifully shown in the\n          <a\n            href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani–Miller_theorem\"\n            style={{ color: \"inherit\", textDecoration: \"underline\" }}\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            Modigliani–Miller theorem\n          </a>\n          , two differently structured classes of capital to value economic\n          enterprises by.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Therefore, while the old theory of Monetarism based on cash supply\n          used to be quite correct, today liquidity is jointly produced by the\n          Federal Reserve and the private market—with the private market\n          mattering more and more as the field of financial instruments grows\n          and the variety of financial instruments continues to be pushed.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Thus the growth rate of the economy becomes much harder to model as it\n          depends on the exercising of non-uniform embedded options markets,\n          although some starter concepts within Fed circles on how to account\n          for this difference discuss reformulating the growth rate formula from\n          being expressed in terms of the sheer sum of M2 money supply sources\n          <a\n            href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisia_monetary_aggregates_index#:~:text=That%20approach%20to%20monetary%20aggregation,aggregates%20or%20Monetary%20Services%20Indexes.\"\n            style={{ color: \"inherit\", textDecoration: \"underline\" }}\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            [1]\n          </a>\n          :\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <MathJax\n            inline\n          >{`\\\\( \\\\Delta M_t = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{jt} - \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{j(t-1)} \\\\)`}</MathJax>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          To the weighted sum of all of the different asset classes being traded\n          across the economy (weighted by liquidity aka usefulness as a medium\n          of exchange):\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <MathJax\n            inline\n          >{`\\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\log M_t^D = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n s_{jt}^* \\\\bigl( \\\\log x_{jt} - \\\\log x_{j,t-1} \\\\bigr) \\\\)`}</MathJax>{\" \"}\n          where each asset class is weighted according to its share of\n          expenditures averaged over two periods of change:\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <MathJax\n            inline\n          >{`\\\\( s_{jt}^* = \\\\tfrac12 ( s_{jt} + s_{j,t-1} ), \\\\quad s_{jt} =\n          \\\\frac{\\\\pi_{jt} x_{jt}}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\pi_{kt} x_{kt}}, \\\\)`}</MathJax>\n        </p>\n        <p>and</p>\n        <p>\n          <MathJax\n            inline\n          >{`\\\\( \\\\pi_{jt} = \\\\frac{R_t - r_{jt}}{1 + R_t}, \\\\)`}</MathJax>{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          with <MathJax inline>{`\\\\(R_t\\\\)`}</MathJax> as the benchmark yield\n          and <MathJax inline>{`\\\\(r_{jt}\\\\)`}</MathJax> the yield of the\n          <MathJax inline>{`\\\\(j\\\\)`}</MathJax>th asset.

An\n          open and technically difficult problem to solve, the point here is to\n          say that currency is not nearly as influential an asset pool in\n          influencing the behavior of the market as other asset classes, and\n          financial instability is felt not just in terms of the stable value of\n          the dollar but in terms of the stable value and liquidity of a variety\n          of stocks of wealth heterogeneously distributed across the US and its\n          society. In fact, most of the supply of physical cash isn't even\n          inside the United States, meaning that the behavior of cash in\n          particular may depend more on behavior in foreign economies or even\n          just in illicit markets like the drug trade, far more so than in other\n          core asset classes which perhaps represent the lever of the American\n          asset stock allocation and growth much more.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Some government levers could still be said to determine the money\n          supply of course—expectations of future economic behavior based on\n          business conditions, historical precedent, and the Federal Reserve's\n          posturing— but also things like private liquidity and international\n          relations.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The hope is that by <b>redefining</b> the supply of money to be more\n          expansive, we can then tease out a clearer signal of why it has been\n          so hard to statistically observe the relationship between the Fed's\n          impression of the money supply and the actual effects of their\n          policies on economic behavior. Factors like the success of the\n          post-2008 Federal Reserve change to providing an interest rate on bank\n          reserves as opposed to their old explicit required amount of reserves\n          having driven the amount of bank reserves from billions into trillions\n          overnight shows that the economy and its regulation ought to be viewed\n          through the lens of assets rather than hard currency being passed\n          around between traders.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          One key policy takeaway of Neo-Monetarism is that the Federal Reserve\n          is actually far more underpowered than people currently understand it\n          to be. The role of banks as the sole source of lending by the Federal\n          Reserve maybe ought to be abandoned. Viewed through the lens of who is\n          providing liquidity in the market, banks shrink to only around 20\n          percent of the whole asset stock, and the rest of the economy—like the\n          <i>insurance</i> industry, where the crisis of 2008 really started—\n          becomes far more important. Maybe quite the thing to consider given\n          the collapse in home insurance across the US from Climate Change and\n          in-coming defunding of government agencies responsible for predicting\n          and responding to natural disasters!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Another implication is that the case for alternative monies and the\n          rise of asset classes like cryptocurrencies becomes not only far more\n          predictable but almost <b>inevitable</b> under the Neo-Monetarist\n          physics of the economy. The market begins to find other ways to\n          process transactions more suitable for exchanging different asset\n          classes, especially across foreign boundaries, which compose the\n          majority of its mass. Digital coins might therefore be predicted to\n          become more useful to handle as the medium of transactions than\n          physical currency. How could the medium of account not, at a bare\n          minimum, be seen as some complex intersection of global currencies,\n          given the impact of multinational corporations—which operate using\n          dozens of currencies at once—on nearly every locality on Earth? Under\n          this light, the U.S. stands to gain the most from the proliferation of\n          cryptocurrency around the world, as it allows actors around the globe\n          to more quickly move from their local exchanges into USD-denominated\n          accounts.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Moreover, given the redefinition of what constitutes the supply of\n          money, perhaps the structure of theoretically predicted expected\n          behavior by economic agents more closely mimics the perception of\n          economic hardship that consumers have been feeling for years. I claim\n          this misalignment led, in large part, to the Democrats' rebuttal, that\n          the current structure of Monetarist economic thought fails to\n          encapsulate in its outdated measurements what provides the bread and\n          butter of everyday economic wealth stocks for the American people.\n          Could this help to provide the previously undefined phantom source for\n          the so-called \"Vibecession\"?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Financial assets are the money of the modern era, and Neo-Monetarism\n          describes the challenge of measuring that new complex of differently\n          structured assets as the key source of noise to control for in\n          bringing the predictions of classic Monetarism into the 21st century.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 id=\"D\">Recompiling 🏋️</h2>\n        <p>\n          I did not invent the concept of the cost-of-living crisis, but I do\n          consider myself uniquely positioned to connect the idea of the\n          cost-of-living crisis to the Vibecession to Monetarism as the source\n          of misunderstandings of the structure of economic hardship. These\n          misunderstandings are misguiding policy and misguiding the\n          calculations of progressive forward-thinking policymakers today.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <iframe\n            width=\"800\"\n            height=\"450\"\n            src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGGuVF_cfL4?start=1862\"\n            title=\"The Trump Comeback and the 2024 Election Results | Raging Moderates\"\n            frameBorder=\"0\"\n            allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n            allowFullScreen\n            referrerPolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n          ></iframe>\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          Experts will tell you that the Biden administration guided the U.S.\n          into a position of global leadership in economic growth and inflation\n          curtailment. As many have pointed out, that very well may have\n          registered in the economy, leading to the defeat of the Democrats\n          receiving the <i>unenviable</i> award of \"smallest rejection\" of the\n          year. But given the fundamentally different structure of expectation\n          propagation that Neo-Monetarism implies—rather than the far more\n          outdated model we're largely thinking within—we begin to see the\n          importance of the crisis in home construction rates and\n          austerity-inspired individual fiscal tightening downstream from the\n          dissolution of the welfare state as more important than ever\n          previously considered in determining what people look to as the\n          economic indicators that matter to them.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"/assets/pics/IMG_1413.JPG\"\n            alt=\"Construction\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-med\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          The primary critique of monetary norms I've seen coming out of this is\n          that people <b>really</b> hate inflation, and the Federal Reserve\n          needs to be even more strict in curtailing inflation next time around.\n          Small amounts of inflation are hugely more electorally destabilizing\n          than a few ticks of unemployment. I think this may be partially\n          true—maybe it's overemphasized because people haven't seen real\n          inflation for so long—but I also think it highlights how the indices\n          we're measuring to indicate the direction of money supply and velocity\n          within the economy are deeply flawed and blind to the realities of the\n          financialized system Americans rely on for the credit and asset\n          accumulation that any and everyone would tell you is the lifeblood of\n          building personal financial success in the 21st century. Maybe the\n          truth is that, as with most issues in Democratic turnout, the people\n          are smelling the smoke coming from the dysfunction in the system, and\n          this articulation is pointing out that that smoke is real and coming\n          from a real fire burning at the heart of our Post-Keynesian status\n          quo!\n        </p>\n        <p>So, what is to be done?</p>\n        <p>\n          We need to build new houses, grease the lines of credit which the\n          American people rely on to make the types of long-term asset\n          accumulation they depend upon, and cut red tape to invest in the\n          capital-intensive factories that fuel financially cutting-edge\n          industrial models like those of the tech industry today.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The aperture of results we need to be measuring within the economy to\n          declare a job well done needs to be widened to encompass all of the\n          various capital classes that make someone really feel like they're\n          living in the vibrant society of a global superpower. Otherwise, we\n          will continue to see the American people throw us out of office in\n          favor of the person telling them that the experts don't know what\n          they're talking about and to give him sole power to \"burn it all down\n          and build, baby, build.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This is the vision I see of a productive narrative for a new American\n          Dream, and a significant portion of my answer to the question: What\n          did we get wrong?\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 id=\"E\">References</h2>\n        <div
