As benchmarks for\n              optimizers have fallen behind the conversation, consensus has\n              shattered, and the forest has been lost for the trees so to say.\n              How to design an optimizer which can work on a wide range of\n              tasks, or even just knowledge of which optimizers are truly\n              durably most useful for particular use cases has receded into the\n              cloud of industry secrets as conversation stalls out on vague and\n              untested claims and the inertia of unknowingly replicating a\n              one-off author’s choice carries forward unbeknownst to the\n              repercussions of said choices. This is the fundamental challenge\n              which <i>Algoperf</i> aims to quantify and clarify in its\n              benchmarking.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The <i>Algoperf</i> team points out four fundamentally problematic\n              dimensions along which previous attempts to quantify comparisons\n              of optimization algorithms in the field have strayed from being\n              maximally informative:\n            </p>\n            <b>Difficulty in Measuring Training speed</b>\n            <p>\n              One of the fundamental strengths which an optimization algorithm\n              can claim over its peers is that it will guide your model to the\n              minimum achievable loss quicker than the alternative choices. But\n              the <i>Algoperf</i> team highlights how in many of the papers\n              describing why to use one optimization algorithm choice over\n              another, arguments resort to the language of generalities (Ex:\n              \"frequently delivers faster convergence\") as opposed to more\n              specific measurements of how reliably faster convergence actually\n              is. In part this is because optimizers tend to outperform or\n              underperform each other differently based on how you decide to\n              measure their error over time or at which point you decide to stop\n              training and compare the two.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <i>Algoperf</i> chooses to measure training speed by picking for\n              every included workload a \"near-state-of-art\" out-of-distribution\n              error rate as a useful heuristic standard to compare every\n              optimization algorithm against.\n            </p>\n            <b>Dependence of Results on Workload</b>\n            <p>\n              This section draws attention to the hard reality benchmarks love\n              to tip-toe around: that the usefulness of an optimization\n              algorithm ought to be judged on the basis of how good it is at\n              getting tasks done which we care about and that to really quantify\n              what choice is best you need to consider quite deeply which\n              workload you’re really trying to get done in the first place.\n              Which jobs are most representative of what optimization algorithms\n              are going to be more used for?\n            </p>\n            <b>Sensitivity of Results to Model Architecture</b>\n            <p>\n              Another issue with leaving optimizer comparison up to the author\n              is that optimizers seem to perform far differently depending on\n              small changes in the base model which they're optimizing. To\n              relate this to the metaphor of descending the valley: the shape of\n              the valley (aka the model space we're in) influences tremendously\n              which set of rules are really going to get us down the fastest. In\n              fact the goal should be to have an optimization algorithm which\n              works the best on as many valleys as possible (or at least a\n              method to know which ones we should be applying it to) and\n              conversation currently tends to bring out one optimization\n              algorithm as generally applicable when the authors are in\n              actuality just observing that it works well on a specific\n              landscape.\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n              <img\n                src=\"/assets/pics/model_architecture_sensitivity.png\"\n                alt=\"Architecture Sensitivity\"\n                style={{ maxWidth: \"700px\", maxHeight: \"300px\" }}\n              />\n              <p className=\"small-text\" style={{ maxWidth: \"650px\" }}>\n                \"After changing from a standard{\" \"}\n                <MathJax inline>{`\\\\(2 \\\\times 2\\\\)`}</MathJax> stride to a{\" \"}\n                <MathJax inline>{`\\\\(1 \\\\times 1\\\\)`}</MathJax> stride, the\n                performance of Nesterov drops significantly while AdamW is\n                largely unaffected.

On the tradeoffs of Algoperf's Design</h2>\n            <p>\n              What makes an idea worthwhile? <i>Algoperf</i> with performance\n              ratios and something akin to: \"if it figures out a way to get the\n              tasks we care about done quicker.\" I really enjoyed digging into\n              (and doing a lot of synthesizing for the purpose of boiling down)\n              this nearly 100 page paper today and am generally awed by the\n              knowledge of optimizer design on display by its authors as well as\n              the extreme attentiveness to other efforts in the field to put\n              benchmarks to optimizers and where they've fallen down before{\" \"}\n              <i>Algoperf</i>.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              An article like this on the topic of benchmarking couldn't be\n              honestly resolved without an acknowledgment of the elephant in the\n              room, that being that in reality most Optimizers end up becoming\n              the norm not based on their pure efficiency to train the model the\n              quickest but instead on some combination of ease of use and\n              general applicability across multiple prioritized tasks—aka those\n              training runs which really attract the big bucks. <i>Algoperf</i>{\" \"}\n              attempts to outline a predefined set of tasks to measure models\n              against and a predefined set of hardware to run those models on,\n              but in actuality the tasks which matter is a moving target roughly\n              tracking the mass of CAPEX and space where models need to be\n              built. It would be fascinating to see an <i>Algoperf</i> which\n              adapts its relevant workload over time and keeps track of which\n              submissions manage to, through the changes in that workload\n              makeup, keep boiling their way up to the top of comparative\n              performance. I also can't help but notice that the specifying of a\n              hardware setup may begin to misrepresent the realities of an\n              optimizer's applicability in the field as niche customized AI\n              accelerators for specific models and hardware changes around\n              models become more and more dominant in-industry.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              One front of benchmarking which, if I were advising the{\" \"}\n              <i>Algoperf</i> team, I would advise more explicitly evaluating\n              stems from the simple observation that the relevant workloads\n              change over time as what is interesting, unsolved, and prioritized\n              in-industry adapts. If <i>Algoperf</i> maintains operation long\n              into the future, as I hope it will, and the workloads which matter\n              diverge from what's currently being compared against, it appears\n              like the <i>Algoperf</i> team would benefit from setting out some\n              set of rules for at which point a workload drops out of relevance\n              or a new one becomes justifiable to include. Once that work has\n              been done, the team at <i>Algoperf</i> could then add into their\n              benchmark score a term which accounts for how consistently across\n              the change of workloads over time an optimizer was able to\n              maintain a high benchmarking score, providing a sort of barometer\n              for how persistently beneficial an optimizer has been throughout\n              the general changes in workloads over time. This can be described\n              poetically using the same Exponential Moving Average (EMA) formula\n              which plays such importance in many optimizer algorithms.
