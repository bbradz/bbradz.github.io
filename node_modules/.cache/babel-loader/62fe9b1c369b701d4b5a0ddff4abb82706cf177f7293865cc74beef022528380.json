When we first initialize a model it's located\n            <i>somewhere</i> in this forest of all possible model parameter\n            settings and we need some intelligent method to descend down out of\n            that dark forest towards the society at the bottom of the valley,\n            wherever that is.

And oh how luxurious it is:\n            the VC talking heads at Sequoia capital, who bankroll a tremendous\n            amount of innovation in The Valley, recently estimated that roughly\n            <a href=\"https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/\">\n              $200 billion in CAPEX\n            </a>\n            was burnt in Q1 of 2024 on the GPUs and electricity needed to, in\n            large part, run the calculations of parameter adjustments needed to\n            bring ginormous models like Google's\n            <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11805\">Gemini</a>, Meta's\n            <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/\">LLama</a>, and\n            <i>of course</i> OpenAI's\n            <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774\">ChatGPT</a> down out of\n            the mountains where they start and into the valleys of usability for\n            mass audiences. This is where the importance of Optimizers and of\n            being able to talk clearly about where optimizers are improving on\n            each other or better suited for particular tasks comes into direct\n            unavoidable focus.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2 id=\"C\">Avoiding Credibility Collapse from flawed Criterion</h2>\n          <p>\n            The fundamental problem <i>Algoperf</i> rises to address is that no\n            matter the paper you choose to pick out from a crowd you'll likely\n            find some line in there talking about how \"[their] Algorithm A\n            outperforms Algorithm B by C%\" and while at a glance those types of\n            sentences seem to attribute some reason to use an author's algorithm\n            over its competitors, digging in deeper, papers are encouraged to\n            (for the sake of garnering attention) inflate the impact of their\n            finding and minimize the number of words spent explaining where\n            their work doesn't actually outperform pre-existing methods, and\n            nowhere is this more obvious than in discourse around choice of\n            Optimizer.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In actuality it's exceedingly difficult to figure out which\n            Optimizer is going to be better as a default pick for your AI\n            training experiments or how to set up your optimizer for the\n            specific project which you're working on. As benchmarks for\n            optimizers have fallen behind the conversation, consensus has\n            shattered, and the forest has been lost for the trees so to say. How\n            to design an optimizer which can work on a wide range of tasks, or\n            even just knowledge of which optimizers are truly durably most\n            useful for particular use cases has receded into the cloud of\n            industry secrets as conversation stalls out on vague and untested\n            claims and the inertia of unknowingly replicating a one-off author’s\n            choice carries forward unbeknownst to the repercussions of said\n            choices. This is the fundamental challenge which <i>Algoperf</i>{\" \"}\n            aims to quantify and clarify in its benchmarking.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The <i>Algoperf</i> team points out four fundamentally problematic\n            dimensions along which previous attempts to quantify comparisons of\n            optimization algorithms in the field have strayed from being\n            maximally informative:\n          </p>\n          <ol>\n            <li>\n              <b>Difficult in Measuring Training speed</b>\n              <p>\n                One of the fundamental strengths which an optimization algorithm\n                can claim over its peers is that it will guide your model to the\n                minimum achievable loss quicker than the alternative choices.\n                But the\n                <i>Algoperf</i> team highlights how in many of the papers\n                describing why to use one optimization algorithm choice over\n                another, arguments resort to the language of generalities (Ex:\n                \"frequently delivers faster convergence\") as opposed to more\n                specific measurements of how reliably faster convergence\n                actually is. In part this is because optimizers tend to\n                outperform or underperform each other differently based on how\n                you decide to measure their error over time or at which point\n                you decide to stop training and compare the two.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                <i>Algoperf</i> chooses to measure training speed by picking for\n                every included workload a \"near-state-of-art\"\n                out-of-distribution error rate as a useful heuristic standard to\n                compare every optimization algorithm against.\n              </p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <b>Dependence of Results on Workload</b>\n              <p>\n                This section draws attention to the hard reality benchmarks love\n                to tip-toe around: that the usefulness of an optimization\n                algorithm ought to be judged on the basis of how good it is at\n                getting tasks done which we care about and that to really\n                quantify what choice is best you need to consider quite deeply\n                which workload you’re really trying to get done in the first\n                place.

On the tradeoffs of Algoperf's Design</h2>\n          <p>\n            What makes an idea worthwhile? <i>Algoperf</i> with performance\n            ratios and something akin to: \"if it figures out a way to get the\n            tasks we care about done quicker.\" I really enjoyed digging into\n            (and doing a lot of synthesizing for the purpose of boiling down)\n            this nearly 100 page paper today and am generally awed by the\n            knowledge of optimizer design on display by its authors as well as\n            the extreme attentiveness to other efforts in the field to put\n            benchmarks to optimizers and where they've fallen down before{\" \"}\n            <i>Algoperf</i>.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            An article like this on the topic of benchmarking couldn't be\n            honestly resolved without an acknowledgment of the elephant in the\n            room, that being that in reality most Optimizers end up becoming the\n            norm not based on their pure efficiency to train the model the\n            quickest but instead on some combination of ease of use and general\n            applicability across multiple prioritized tasks—aka those training\n            runs which really attract the big bucks. <i>Algoperf</i> attempts to\n            outline a predefined set of tasks to measure models against and a\n            predefined set of hardware to run those models on, but in actuality\n            the tasks which matter is a moving target roughly tracking the mass\n            of CAPEX and space where models need to be built. It would be\n            fascinating to see an <i>Algoperf</i> which adapts its relevant\n            workload over time and keeps track of which submissions manage to,\n            through the changes in that workload makeup, keep boiling their way\n            up to the top of comparative performance. I also can't help but\n            notice that the specifying of a hardware setup may begin to\n            misrepresent the realities of an optimizer's applicability in the\n            field as niche customized AI accelerators for specific models and\n            hardware changes around models become more and more dominant\n            in-industry.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            One front of benchmarking which, if I were advising the\n            <i>Algoperf</i> team, I would advise more explicitly evaluating\n            stems from the simple observation that the relevant workloads change\n            over time as what is interesting, unsolved, and prioritized\n            in-industry adapts. If\n            <i>Algoperf</i> maintains operation long into the future, as I hope\n            it will, and the workloads which matter diverge from what's\n            currently being compared against, it appears like the{\" \"}\n            <i>Algoperf</i> team would benefit from setting out some set of\n            rules for at which point a workload drops out of relevance or a new\n            one becomes justifiable to include. Once that work has been done,\n            the team at <i>Algoperf</i> could then add into their benchmark\n            score a term which accounts for how consistently across the change\n            of workloads over time an optimizer was able to maintain a high\n            benchmarking score, providing a sort of barometer for how\n            persistently beneficial an optimizer has been throughout the general\n            changes in workloads over time. This can be described poetically\n            using the same Exponential Moving Average (EMA) formula which plays\n            such importance in many optimizer algorithms. Given a set{\" \"}\n            {`\\( \\varrho = \\{\n            \\rho_{1}^{S}, \\rho_{2}^{S}, ..., \\rho_{n}^{S} \\} \\)`}{\" \"}\n            of {`\\(n \\)`} benchmark evaluations conducted on some set of\n            optimizers {`\\(S \\)`}, the team at\n            <i>Algoperf</i> could define the following momentum-of-performance\n            term:\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            {`\\[ \\alpha(t) = \\begin{cases} \\rho_{1}^{S} & \\text{if } t = 1 \\\\ \\beta\n            \\cdot \\rho_{t-1}^{S} + (1 - \\beta) \\cdot \\rho_{t}^{S} & \\text{if } t > 1\n            \\end{cases} \\]`}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If this hasn't been considered I think it should be as it would take\n            <i>Algoperf</i> beyond a \"simple\" evaluation of many optimizers on\n            one set of workloads towards telling the community which optimizers\n            prove themselves to be reliably useful even as the workload changes\n            over time.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Times are interesting and overall <i>Algoperf</i> provides an\n            invaluable tool for sorting through the noise and learning to\n            understand where the hype clears out into a real struggle to find\n            the techniques which represent real progress. My thanks to the\n            authors for their thoughtful grappling with this problem and I can\n            only tie this article up with the graph which their 1000s of hours\n            of effort
