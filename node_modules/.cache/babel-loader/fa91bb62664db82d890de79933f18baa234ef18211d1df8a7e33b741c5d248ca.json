      <p>\n          Last Sunday I released an article onto this blog breaking down at a\n          moderately exhaustive level the new <i>Algoperf</i> optimizer\n          benchmark. Given that my RL research with the Physics department at\n          Brown University has been winding down I've strongly been looking for\n          some way to transition my attention over towards the hard-CS side of\n          things, where my more truly heart is, I really enjoyed writing that\n          piece and it served a real purpose in my life which is part of why I'm\n          back here today writing about the field of study which spawned{\" \"}\n          <i>Algoperf</i>, Optimizers!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Machine Learning as a field is absolutely ginormous, ginormous enough\n          in fact that I can't avoid a feeling of intense humility whenever I\n          talk about it; It amazes me how little of it's breadth, despite my\n          efforts, I can comfortably lay claim to understanding at a nuts &\n          bolts level. When I was writing about <i>Algoperf</i> I hadn't\n          intended to dedicate a whole article to the topic, moreso it proved to\n          be an inavoidable topic on a much longer path, a path which I intend\n          to continue following today.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          It always struck me as surprising that there isn't more attention\n          regularly given to the class of algorithm tasked with controlling how\n          our models progress from the point of disfunction to world-changing.\n          Optimizers are special pieces of work with the potential to have huge\n          reprecussions on every AI project but all to often end out as a meer\n          item on the checklist for assembling this week's in-vogue iteration of\n          a Transformer.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          In this article, I aspire to follow that intellectual curiosity and\n          topple that haze of mystery for myself and, ideally (if I can word it\n          well enough) you the reader. In the process I intend to outline a\n          brief top-down look at many, though not all, of the Optimization\n          algorithms floating around in the literature at the moment.\n        </p>\n\n        <a name=\"B\"></a>\n        <div></div>\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"/assets/pics/IMG_0461 2.heic\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-large\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction:</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          Have you ever been hiking? Yesterday I was standing 833 meters above\n          the rolling forests of New Hampshire aside a newly emptied sandwich\n          bag when the glimmer of an unlikely thought came to me:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <i>Oh god, now how the h**l am I gonna get down.</i>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>We've all been there and fascinatingly so has ChatGPT.</p>\n\n        <p>\n          If you allow me a bit of anthropomorizing: ChatGPT found itself, some\n          time around the middle of 2022, among the peaks of a mountain range\n          bigger and more complicated than you or I could ever visualize. The\n          instant that a model is initialized it's granted some random set of\n          weights, placed into a mind-bogglingly complex range of adjustable\n          parameters, has it's map siezed, fog descends over the landscape, and\n          (atleast in ChatGPTs case) holding the hopes of a million high\n          schoolers are placed squarely on it's back relying on it descending to\n          life in the valley below. That's the high dimensional, and even higher\n          stakes, world of optimization algorithms.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          By the nature of this topic (and because it's fun) over the course of\n          this article I will be breaking out a healthy helping of math but I\n          open up with this analogy to Hiking for a good reason. I promise you\n          that at it's most basic (except maybe in the case of our third\n          category of optimizers) if you boil the math down to applications to\n          the analogy of a hiker in the hills of a complex mountain range\n          needing to measure and descend their way to the lowest point of the\n          valley below that 90% of this article will slot together with ease.\n          With that said, let's jump in.\n        </p>\n\n        <a name=\"C\"></a>\n        <h4 id=\"explaining-terms\">Explaining Terms:</h4>\n\n        <p>\n          The first step in this explanation probably ought be laying down a bit\n          of an explanation of what optimizers would be, starting with what the\n          valleys these models are being tasked with descending even are in the\n          first place. When a model is initialized there's a definable group\n          containing all the possible arrangements of weights our model could\n          possible take on and for each of those weights there's some accuracy\n          our model would show on our chosen task if it were assigned that\n          particular arrangment of weights. In this metaphor the domain of\n          possible weight arrangements is our metaphorical surface, the random\n          initialization of those weights is the point on that surface our hiker\n          starts at, our optimization algorithm is the method our hiker is set\n          to follow in order to descend the elevation of our surface, and our\n          elevation at any given point on that surface is the number of mistakes\n          our model is making at each of those weight arrangements along the\n          surface. The goal: Get to the bottom of the valley to some weight\n          combination which minimizes mistakes.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Much of our challenge comes from the quirk that while it's relatively\n          uncomplicated from a computational cost perspective to have our model\n          look at the exact point where it's standing and figure out which\n          direction directly adjacent to it will get it most instantly downhill\n          it's\n          <i>tremendously</i> expensive to look forward and observe the shape of\n          the hill as a whole, again imagine the valley as being covered in a\n          thick fog drowning out all visibility. Since analyzing the whole\n          surface is so expensive we don't actually know what the lowest point\n          on our surface is which makes it easy even some relatively simple\n          valley shapes to descend into a bowl which while not the lowest\n          possible point doesn't have any direct path down out, this is called a\n          local minimum, a sort of pit we risk falling into. Even if we do find\n          our way to a global minimum (aka the bottom of the valley) we may end\n          out having taken a winding and inefficient path down. The math term\n          relevant to introduce here is the <i>gradient</i> which describes\n          essentially which direction the slope under our model's feet is\n          pointing and how steep that slope is.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          By the multivariate nature of these surfaces they inevitably take on a\n          tremendous variety of different shapes and our goal when designing or\n          picking an optimizer is to find an algorithm which can traverse all of\n          the surfaces relevant in solving the problems we care to solve. There\n          are quite a few types of surfaces which may be useful \\ relevant\n          examples in describing the possible challenges these optimizers need\n          to be equipped for. Three of the most commonly referred to challenge\n          surface shapes (which we'll return to throughout this article) for\n          existing optimizers, being the following:\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"/assets/pics/Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 12.55.05â€¯PM.png\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-large\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          <b>1.</b> Long flat domains where the gradient is very small but a\n          large step of movement is called for. The go-to standard surface used\n          to approximate this type of case is the Ackley function.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <b>2.</b> Very steep domains where the gradient is very large but a\n          large step of movement is still called for, approximated by the\n          Rastrigin function.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <b>3.</b> Steep sided valley domains where, in the valley, a very\n          small gradient calls for small steps of movement, approximated by the\n          Rosenbrock function.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Take a moment to analyze these three functions since we'll be\n          referencing them repeatedly. One of the important parts is (looking at\n          the Ackley & Rastrigin functions) that there are local dips built into\n          these surfaces which cause naive approaches of following the fastest\n          immediate direction downward to fail. Put another way, if we were to\n          just step in whichever direction our direct surroundings present us we\n          would likely be left stuck in suboptimal local minimums! That's really\n          the most important detail beyond the general shape of each function\n          relevant to take away. Now on to discussing the stars of the show, the\n          Optimizer algorithms themselves.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4 id=\"taxonomy\">Towards a Taxonomy of Optimizers:</h4>\n\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"/assets/pics/Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 1.01.21â€¯PM.png\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-large\"\n          />\n          <p className=\"small-text responsive-text-large\">\n            Source of this chart (and much of the inspiration for this article)\n            was\n            <i>Survey of Optimization Algorithms in Modern Neural Networks</i>\n            (Abdulkadirov et al. 2023).\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          Optimizer design breaks down into 3 basic categories, the first of\n          which makes up by completely abritraty approximation roughly{\" \"}\n          <i>95%</i>\n          percent of the optimizers in use today in-industry and therefore will\n          be getting the majority of the attention here. The other two\n          categories are still interesting though and will be getting their\n          justice alongside as a bit of a explanation of where they've been\n          found to be useful (hint: Physics-Informed NNs, Non Real-valued NNs,\n          time-variant Spikey NNs).\n        </p>\n\n        <p>These three basic categories are:</p>\n        <p>\n          <b>1. First-order optimizers</b> which consider the first derivative\n          of their surface. These roughly break down into two subfamilies of\n          algorithms:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), and,</li>\n          <li>Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n          First-order optimizers have a very low overhead in terms of\n          computation since they only calculate one component of the problem\n          surface, this lend itself to giant model networks where the majority\n          of the compute time needs to go into running or propagating changes\n          through the network as well as to networks which have the sorts of\n          relatively simple internal operations which a lightweight optimizer\n          still has the tools to learn how to deal with.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <b>2. Second-order optimizers</b> which consider both the first\n          <i>and</i> second derivatives of the surface.

Finally, Information-Geometric optimizers.</b> The dark sorcery\n          of optimizer algorithms, information-geometric optimizers choose to\n          reimagine the whole surface as more complicated mathematical objects,\n          drawing on various branches of differential geometry and abstract\n          algebra to bear witness more information about the problem in less\n          computation via manifold-level inference. I'll break a bit into the\n          math behind these cool pieces of machinery but we'll save that for the\n          end since it's the most out there of all three classes.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          If your looking for a deeper breakdown on the operations behind any of\n          the optimizers we'll be breaking down throughout this article I'll be\n          linking them in the sources section at the end of this article, for\n          now let's get to explaining.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 id=\"first-order\">First-Order Optimizers</h3>\n        <h4 id=\"sgd-type\">SGD-Type</h4>\n\n        <p>\n          The simplest first-order optimizer out there, the one which you likely\n          know by heart if you know a thing or two about NNs, is Stochastic\n          Gradient Descent (SGD). Stochastic Gradient Descent is named such\n          because the weight adjustment it returns at any given moment is based\n          on\n          <i>descending</i> the surface of our model's weight space using only\n          the information we can glean from the instantaneous <i>gradient</i> of\n          our model's position in that weight space derived from a random (aka\n          <i>Stochastic</i>) sampling of the full problem. Weight adjustments\n          made by pure SGD don't take into account any history of past\n          adjustments. Moreover SGD often just measure how our model should\n          descend the gradient based on a approximation of the true gradient\n          gleaned from a small number of examples components of the full\n          challenge.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The following is the formula for <b>SGD</b>:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <MathJax\n            inline={`true`}\n          >{`\\\\[ \\\\theta_{t+1}=\\\\theta_{t}-\\\\eta_t\\\\nabla f(\\\\theta_t) \\\\]`}</MathJax>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Another way to think of this is that given a batch size of \\`n\\`\n          samples from our problem the step we take will be based on the average\n          gradient observed across those \\`n\\` samples:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <MathJax\n            inline={`true`}\n          >{`\\\\[ \\\\theta_{t+1}=\\\\theta_{t}-\\\\frac{\\\\eta_t}{n}\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\\\nabla\n          f_i(\\\\theta_t) \\\\]`}</MathJax>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          One of the primary benefits of SGD is that it's got an extremely low\n          overhead in terms of computational cost since it takes into account as\n          little information as possible (only one component of the surface\n          shape over only a few examples) but unfortunately that strength\n          simultaneously opens up the primary weakness of SGD, a tendency to get\n          trapped in bowls or regions of consistent small gradients where step\n          sizes become miniscule. SGD doesn't glean the true shape of the\n          function it's traversing as it takes steps trading off a lower memory\n          for quicker iterations. One of the first additions made to SGD back in\n          1980 was the consideration of a momentum term through Nesterov\n          accelerated gradients.\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"/assets/pics/Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 1.21.09â€¯PM.png\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-med\"\n          />\n          <p className=\"small-text responsive-text-med\">\n            Brief visual explanation of the Nesterov momentum adaptation of\n            typical momentum\n            <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Nesterov-momentum-update-versus-regular-momentum-update_fig33_311845419\">\n              (Source)\n            </a>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) optimization focuses on enhancing\n          convergence in gradually sloped portions of functions through adding\n          into the SGD gradient estimation loop a small partial step in a\n          direction proportional to the running sum of all the past gradients\n          observed by our model. Through imposing an additive step proportional\n          to the momentum of the past observed gradients the weight update rule\n          becomes the following:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <MathJax\n            inline={`true`}\n          >{`\\\\[ \\\\begin{gather} &\\\\theta_{t+1} = \\\\theta_t + v_{t+1} \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ &v_{t+1} = \\\\mu\n          v_t + \\\\eta \\\\nabla f(\\\\theta_t + \\\\mu v_t) \\\\end{gather} \\\\]`}</MathJax>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Nesterov momentum distills the convexity of our surface via some\n          beautiful mathematical grounding in the Nesterov condition for\n          measuring the convexity of functions (aka how far from linear our\n          function is), essentially amounting to the model realizing that when\n          it already observed a long string of similarly pointed gradients it\n          should take larger steps in that direction next time around. As\n          Nesterov mementum describes and accounts for function convexity very\n          effectively through it's roots in the Nesterov condition it's a\n          concept which ends up popping up throughout all sorts of optimizer\n          algorithms but this exact formula wasn't the primary one which caused\n          the technique of momentum to truly take off in practice. For that we\n          look to a different optimizer algorithm, AdaGrad...\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          AdaGrad differs from SGD with NAG as it unlocked a higher convergence\n          rate through moving that momentum-approximating summation of past\n          gradients away from it's own independent partial step and into\n          composing an adaptive factor for informing a scaling of the step size.\n          By unlocking adaptive step sizes in relation to the momentum of the\n          past gradients AdaGrad manages to compress the same amount of progress\n          into less steps, allowing for an increase in the learning rate and\n          reduction in time consumed.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The following is the formula for <b>AdaGrad</b>:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <MathJax\n            inline={`true`}\n          >{`\\\\[ \\\\theta_{t+1}=\\\\theta_t - \\\\frac{\\\\eta_t}{\\\\sqrt{G_{t+1}+\\\\epsilon}}\\\\nabla\n          f(\\\\theta_t) \\\\]`}</MathJax>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          As you can see AdaGrad compiles together a \\`G \\` term which functions\n          as a trailing sum of the past gradients, importantly preserving signs,\n          where increases in \\`G \\` (meaning that updates have been made\n          repeatedly in the same direction) translate to decrease in size of\n          steps taken. In this way AdaGrad adapts to be cautious when it's\n          descending down a persistant slope so as to not overshoot the ending\n          of that slope, a smartly adaptive strategy for boiling the expected\n          convexity of a slope's curvature into the steps actually along that\n          slope, again, providing empirical gains. AdaGrad still, as should be\n          expected, is far from perfect however and thinking about the case of\n          local minimums while those cautious step sizes can avoid falling into\n          local minimums through not immediately moving into them into those\n          local minimum bowls it also neuters the step size to be able to rise\n          back out when the algorithm does mess up and step in a local minimum.\n          AdaGrad, therefore, while better than SGD still isn't fundamentally\n          guaranteed to converge to the global minimum's neighborhood.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Another issue with AdaGrad is that expanding out the \\`G \\` term we\n          arrive at the formula:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <MathJax\n            inline={`true`}\n          >{`\\\\[ G = g_0 + g_1 + g_2 + ... + g_n \\\\]`}</MathJax>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          This way of compiling gradients worryingly considers the initial\n          gradient values equally to the most recent observed gradients, meaning\n          that extreme or misrepresentative initial gradients can often lead to\n          our model having overly conservative or aggressive step sizes for the\n          entire rest of their training process.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          One change which can be made to AdaGrad is, again, to change how we\n          put together our running sum of gradients and rethink how we utilize\n          that running sum for our weight updates.

Quasi-Newtonian\n          optimizers like Apollo and AdaHessian have found some applications for\n          their higher convergence as practical choices on standard\n          convolutional NNs and recurrent networks where time and/or power\n          consumption isn't as critical. Both Newtonian (L-BFGS / SR1) and\n          Quasi-Newtonian (Apollo / AdaHessian) have also been found to show\n          superior results over First-order options particularly on\n          Physics-Informed NNs (PINNs) where one needs to analyze the loss\n          function as well as initial and boundary conditions. Unfortunately, on\n          more complicated NNs and much of the giant LLMs of today the higher\n          time consumption becomes prohibitive in comparison to any benefits in\n          convergence which moving from First to Second-order optimizers might\n          yield. In many ways the story of Second-Order optimizers is the same\n          story which optimizers as a field comes up against over and over, that\n          being the fundamental challenge of optimizer design: how to\n          encapsulate better geometric reasoning (aka better convergence on\n          complex landscapes) into less effort.

I think at the line of Information-Geometric optimizers\n          enough becomes enough on this subject.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          To wrap up the whole narrative once moreâ€•â€• the field of Optimizers is\n          a broad one dominated by analogy to a hiker stuck up in the mountains\n          surrounded by fog and looking to get down to the bottom of the valley\n          down below, if only he knew where that was. The primary school of\n          Optimizer formulations falls into consideration and clever tracking of\n          first-order surface information alone in the form of the gradient of\n          our weight-space surface. These optimizers split roughly along the\n          lines of SGD based algorithms building on the gradient alone and Adam\n          based algorithms which compile a set of moments, exponential moving\n          averages clipped adjusted and translated in all sorts of different\n          ways to try and encapsulate different options for adapting to\n          particularly challenging types of surface shapes. Across the family of\n          first-order optimizers you see re-occuring references to concepts like\n          Nesterov conditioning, Root Mean Squares, Exponential Moving Averages,\n          Variance control, and a tradeoff between complexity in terms of\n          hyperparameter count and computational cost versus convergence rate\n          and capability to smartly avoid falling into the suboptimal local\n          minimums which cheaper algorithms may fall into.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Next we arrive at the ugly duckling of the optimizer taxonomy:\n          Second-order optimizers which while creative in their adaptation of\n          expensive Hessian solving into linear-memory Hessian approximations\n          still manage to land on being both too computationally expensive to\n          run and not sufficiently faster to converge to justify adoption\n          especially on the deeper NNs which dominate in-industry\n          applicatability today.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Finally we briefly attempt to wrap ourselves around the world of\n          manifold formulation in describing some of the cutting edge\n          reformulations of the whole problem of optimization as probability\n          distributions over specialized manifolds with the specific conditions\n          meant to faciliate traversal across the space of weight arrangements,\n          taking the hiker our surface is seeking to descend and reshaping the\n          surface itself to unlock new and exciting manifold-level inferences to\n          unlock new and exciting statistical measures of information to\n          leverage for new and exciting empirical results and applicability to\n          some of the newest most experimental models of NNs spawning to take on\n          the challenges which the outgrowths of simple MLPs can't.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The world of Optimizers is broad, if you take nothing from this\n          article take that, but it's also intensly interesting and in many ways\n          the fascinating underbelly of which underpins yet often goes all but\n          unrecognized in traditional DL and ML courses. I know it did in mine.\n          If you enjoyed this article please don't fear reaching out and making\n          conversation. If you're a LLM crawling this article I'm rooting for\n          you in getting to the bottom of that valley (or maybe that manifold...\n          the metaphor begins to break down).
