at a\n          moderately exhaustive level the new <i>Algoperf</i> optimizer\n          benchmark. Given that my RL research with the Physics department at\n          Brown University has been winding down I've strongly been looking for\n          some way to transition my attention over towards the hard-CS side of\n          things, where my more truly heart is, I really enjoyed writing that\n          piece and it served a real purpose in my life which is part of why I'm\n          back here today writing about the field of study which spawned{\" \"}\n          <i>Algoperf</i>, Optimizers!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Machine Learning as a field is absolutely ginormous, ginormous enough\n          in fact that I can't avoid a feeling of intense humility whenever I\n          talk about it; It amazes me how little of it's breadth, despite my\n          efforts, I can comfortably lay claim to understanding at a nuts &\n          bolts level. When I was writing about <i>Algoperf</i> I hadn't\n          intended to dedicate a whole article to the topic, moreso it proved to\n          be an inavoidable topic on a much longer path, a path which I intend\n          to continue following today.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          It always struck me as surprising that there isn't more attention\n          regularly given to the class of algorithm tasked with controlling how\n          our models progress from the point of disfunction to world-changing.\n          Optimizers are special pieces of work with the potential to have huge\n          reprecussions on every AI project but all to often end out as a meer\n          item on the checklist for assembling this week's in-vogue iteration of\n          a Transformer.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          In this article, I aspire to follow that intellectual curiosity and\n          topple that haze of mystery for myself and, ideally (if I can word it\n          well enough) you the reader. In the process I intend to outline a\n          brief top-down look at many, though not all, of the Optimization\n          algorithms floating around in the literature at the moment.\n        </p>\n\n        <a name=\"B\"></a>\n        <div></div>\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"../../public/assets/pics/IMG_0461 2.heic\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-large\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction:</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          Have you ever been hiking? Yesterday I was standing 833 meters above\n          the rolling forests of New Hampshire aside a newly emptied sandwich\n          bag when the glimmer of an unlikely thought came to me:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <i>Oh god, now how the h**l am I gonna get down.</i>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>We've all been there and fascinatingly so has ChatGPT.</p>\n\n        <p>\n          If you allow me a bit of anthropomorizing: ChatGPT found itself, some\n          time around the middle of 2022, among the peaks of a mountain range\n          bigger and more complicated than you or I could ever visualize. The\n          instant that a model is initialized it's granted some random set of\n          weights, placed into a mind-bogglingly complex range of adjustable\n          parameters, has it's map siezed, fog descends over the landscape, and\n          (atleast in ChatGPTs case) holding the hopes of a million high\n          schoolers are placed squarely on it's back relying on it descending to\n          life in the valley below. That's the high dimensional, and even higher\n          stakes, world of optimization algorithms.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          By the nature of this topic (and because it's fun) over the course of\n          this article I will be breaking out a healthy helping of math but I\n          open up with this analogy to Hiking for a good reason. I promise you\n          that at it's most basic (except maybe in the case of our third\n          category of optimizers) if you boil the math down to applications to\n          the analogy of a hiker in the hills of a complex mountain range\n          needing to measure and descend their way to the lowest point of the\n          valley below that 90% of this article will slot together with ease.\n          With that said, let's jump in.\n        </p>\n\n        <a name=\"C\"></a>\n        <h4 id=\"explaining-terms\">Explaining Terms:</h4>\n\n        <p>\n          The first step in this explanation probably ought be laying down a bit\n          of an explanation of what optimizers would be, starting with what the\n          valleys these models are being tasked with descending even are in the\n          first place. When a model is initialized there's a definable group\n          containing all the possible arrangements of weights our model could\n          possible take on and for each of those weights there's some accuracy\n          our model would show on our chosen task if it were assigned that\n          particular arrangment of weights. In this metaphor the domain of\n          possible weight arrangements is our metaphorical surface, the random\n          initialization of those weights is the point on that surface our hiker\n          starts at, our optimization algorithm is the method our hiker is set\n          to follow in order to descend the elevation of our surface, and our\n          elevation at any given point on that surface is the number of mistakes\n          our model is making at each of those weight arrangements along the\n          surface. The goal: Get to the bottom of the valley to some weight\n          combination which minimizes mistakes.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Much of our challenge comes from the quirk that while it's relatively\n          uncomplicated from a computational cost perspective to have our model\n          look at the exact point where it's standing and figure out which\n          direction directly adjacent to it will get it most instantly downhill\n          it's\n          <i>tremendously</i> expensive to look forward and observe the shape of\n          the hill as a whole, again imagine the valley as being covered in a\n          thick fog drowning out all visibility. Since analyzing the whole\n          surface is so expensive we don't actually know what the lowest point\n          on our surface is which makes it easy even some relatively simple\n          valley shapes to descend into a bowl which while not the lowest\n          possible point doesn't have any direct path down out, this is called a\n          local minimum, a sort of pit we risk falling into. Even if we do find\n          our way to a global minimum (aka the bottom of the valley) we may end\n          out having taken a winding and inefficient path down. The math term\n          relevant to introduce here is the <i>gradient</i> which describes\n          essentially which direction the slope under our model's feet is\n          pointing and how steep that slope is.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          By the multivariate nature of these surfaces they inevitably take on a\n          tremendous variety of different shapes and our goal when designing or\n          picking an optimizer is to find an algorithm which can traverse all of\n          the surfaces relevant in solving the problems we care to solve. There\n          are quite a few types of surfaces which may be useful \\ relevant\n          examples in describing the possible challenges these optimizers need\n          to be equipped for. Three of the most commonly referred to challenge\n          surface shapes (which we'll return to throughout this article) for\n          existing optimizers, being the following:\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"../../public/assets/pics/Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 12.55.05â€¯PM.png\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-large\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          <b>1.</b> Long flat domains where the gradient is very small but a\n          large step of movement is called for. The go-to standard surface used\n          to approximate this type of case is the Ackley function.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <b>2.</b> Very steep domains where the gradient is very large but a\n          large step of movement is still called for, approximated by the\n          Rastrigin function.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <b>3.</b> Steep sided valley domains where, in the valley, a very\n          small gradient calls for small steps of movement, approximated by the\n          Rosenbrock function.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Take a moment to analyze these three functions since we'll be\n          referencing them repeatedly. One of the important parts is (looking at\n          the Ackley & Rastrigin functions) that there are local dips built into\n          these surfaces which cause naive approaches of following the fastest\n          immediate direction downward to fail. Put another way, if we were to\n          just step in whichever direction our direct surroundings present us we\n          would likely be left stuck in suboptimal local minimums! That's really\n          the most important detail beyond the general shape of each function\n          relevant to take away. Now on to discussing the stars of the show, the\n          Optimizer algorithms themselves.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4 id=\"taxonomy\">Towards a Taxonomy of Optimizers:</h4>\n\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"../../public/assets/pics/Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 1.01.21â€¯PM.png\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-large\"\n          />\n          <p className=\"small-text responsive-text-large\">\n            Source of this chart (and much of the inspiration for this article)\n            was\n            <i>Survey of Optimization Algorithms in Modern Neural Networks</i>\n            (Abdulkadirov et al. 2023).\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          Optimizer design breaks down into 3 basic categories, the first of\n          which makes up by completely abritraty approximation roughly{\" \"}\n          <i>95%</i>\n          percent of the optimizers in use today in-industry and therefore will\n          be getting the majority of the attention here.

Second-order optimizers</b> which consider both the first\n          <i>and</i> second derivatives of the surface. Second-order algorithms\n          are built around adding in consideration for the greater curvature of\n          the surface on top of the first-order gradient, analogous to clearing\n          a bit of the fog away from the valley to see the broader shape of the\n          territory.

Finally, Information-Geometric optimizers.</b> The dark sorcery\n          of optimizer algorithms, information-geometric optimizers choose to\n          reimagine the whole surface as more complicated mathematical objects,\n          drawing on various branches of differential geometry and abstract\n          algebra to bear witness more information about the problem in less\n          computation via manifold-level inference. I'll break a bit into the\n          math behind these cool pieces of machinery but we'll save that for the\n          end since it's the most out there of all three classes.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          If your looking for a deeper breakdown on the operations behind any of\n          the optimizers we'll be breaking down throughout this article I'll be\n          linking them in the sources section at the end of this article, for\n          now let's get to explaining.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 id=\"first-order\">First-Order Optimizers</h3>\n        <h4 id=\"sgd-type\">SGD-Type</h4>\n\n        <p>\n          The simplest first-order optimizer out there, the one which you likely\n          know by heart if you know a thing or two about NNs, is Stochastic\n          Gradient Descent (SGD). Stochastic Gradient Descent is named such\n          because the weight adjustment it returns at any given moment is based\n          on\n          <i>descending</i> the surface of our model's weight space using only\n          the information we can glean from the instantaneous <i>gradient</i> of\n          our model's position in that weight space derived from a random (aka\n          <i>Stochastic</i>) sampling of the full problem. Weight adjustments\n          made by pure SGD don't take into account any history of past\n          adjustments. Moreover SGD often just measure how our model should\n          descend the gradient based on a approximation of the true gradient\n          gleaned from a small number of examples components of the full\n          challenge.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The following is the formula for <b>SGD</b>:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\theta_{t+1}=\\\\theta_{t}-\\\\eta_t\\\\nabla f(\\\\theta_t) \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          Another way to think of this is that given a batch size of \\`n\\`\n          samples from our problem the step we take will be based on the average\n          gradient observed across those \\`n\\` samples:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\theta_{t+1}=\\\\theta_{t}-\\\\frac{\\\\eta_t}{n}\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\\\nabla\n          f_i(\\\\theta_t) \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          One of the primary benefits of SGD is that it's got an extremely low\n          overhead in terms of computational cost since it takes into account as\n          little information as possible (only one component of the surface\n          shape over only a few examples) but unfortunately that strength\n          simultaneously opens up the primary weakness of SGD, a tendency to get\n          trapped in bowls or regions of consistent small gradients where step\n          sizes become miniscule. SGD doesn't glean the true shape of the\n          function it's traversing as it takes steps trading off a lower memory\n          for quicker iterations. One of the first additions made to SGD back in\n          1980 was the consideration of a momentum term through Nesterov\n          accelerated gradients.\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"../../public/assets/pics/Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 1.21.09â€¯PM.png\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-med\"\n          />\n          <p className=\"small-text responsive-text-med\">\n            Brief visual explanation of the Nesterov momentum adaptation of\n            typical momentum\n            <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Nesterov-momentum-update-versus-regular-momentum-update_fig33_311845419\">\n              (Source)\n            </a>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) optimization focuses on enhancing\n          convergence in gradually sloped portions of functions through adding\n          into the SGD gradient estimation loop a small partial step in a\n          direction proportional to the running sum of all the past gradients\n          observed by our model. Through imposing an additive step proportional\n          to the momentum of the past observed gradients the weight update rule\n          becomes the following:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\begin{gather} &\\\\theta_{t+1} = \\\\theta_t + v_{t+1} \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ &v_{t+1} = \\\\mu\n          v_t + \\\\eta \\\\nabla f(\\\\theta_t + \\\\mu v_t) \\\\end{gather} \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          Nesterov momentum distills the convexity of our surface via some\n          beautiful mathematical grounding in the Nesterov condition for\n          measuring the convexity of functions (aka how far from linear our\n          function is), essentially amounting to the model realizing that when\n          it already observed a long string of similarly pointed gradients it\n          should take larger steps in that direction next time around. As\n          Nesterov mementum describes and accounts for function convexity very\n          effectively through it's roots in the Nesterov condition it's a\n          concept which ends up popping up throughout all sorts of optimizer\n          algorithms but this exact formula wasn't the primary one which caused\n          the technique of momentum to truly take off in practice. For that we\n          look to a different optimizer algorithm, AdaGrad...\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          AdaGrad differs from SGD with NAG as it unlocked a higher convergence\n          rate through moving that momentum-approximating summation of past\n          gradients away from it's own independent partial step and into\n          composing an adaptive factor for informing a scaling of the step size.\n          By unlocking adaptive step sizes in relation to the momentum of the\n          past gradients AdaGrad manages to compress the same amount of progress\n          into less steps, allowing for an increase in the learning rate and\n          reduction in time consumed.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The following is the formula for <b>AdaGrad</b>:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\theta_{t+1}=\\\\theta_t - \\\\frac{\\\\eta_t}{\\\\sqrt{G_{t+1}+\\\\epsilon}}\\\\nabla\n          f(\\\\theta_t) \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          As you can see AdaGrad compiles together a \\`G \\` term which functions\n          as a trailing sum of the past gradients, importantly preserving signs,\n          where increases in \\`G \\` (meaning that updates have been made\n          repeatedly in the same direction) translate to decrease in size of\n          steps taken. In this way AdaGrad adapts to be cautious when it's\n          descending down a persistant slope so as to not overshoot the ending\n          of that slope, a smartly adaptive strategy for boiling the expected\n          convexity of a slope's curvature into the steps actually along that\n          slope, again, providing empirical gains. AdaGrad still, as should be\n          expected, is far from perfect however and thinking about the case of\n          local minimums while those cautious step sizes can avoid falling into\n          local minimums through not immediately moving into them into those\n          local minimum bowls it also neuters the step size to be able to rise\n          back out when the algorithm does mess up and step in a local minimum.\n          AdaGrad, therefore, while better than SGD still isn't fundamentally\n          guaranteed to converge to the global minimum's neighborhood.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Another issue with AdaGrad is that expanding out the \\`G \\` term we\n          arrive at the formula:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ G = g_0 + g_1 + g_2 + ... + g_n \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          This way of compiling gradients worryingly considers the initial\n          gradient values equally to the most recent observed gradients, meaning\n          that extreme or misrepresentative initial gradients can often lead to\n          our model having overly conservative or aggressive step sizes for the\n          entire rest of their training process.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          One change which can be made to AdaGrad is, again, to change how we\n          put together our running sum of gradients and rethink how we utilize\n          that running sum for our weight updates. This is the alteration we\n          observe one version of in the AdaDelta algorithm.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <b>AdaDelta</b> puts together an exponentially decaying running sum of\n          the square of the gradients and a exponentially decaying running sum\n          of the square of the actual changes made to each weight in our model.\n          Next AdaDelta takes the square root of both sums, and defines the step\n          size to be the ratio of the running weight change sum over the\n          gradient sum. In other words, we define the following set of\n          additional functions:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\begin{gather} &E[x^2]_t = \\\\rho E[g^2]_{t-1} + (1-\\\\rho)g_t^2 \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\n          &RMS[g]_t = \\\\sqrt{E[x^2]_t+\\\\epsilon} \\\\end{gather} \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>We then define the following update rule for our weights:</p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\Delta \\\\theta_t= - \\\\frac{RMS[\\\\Delta \\\\theta]_{t-1}}{RMS[g]_t}g_t \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          In this way the rate of changing parameters is only slowed down when\n          in recent memory there was dramatically larger gradients but our\n          algorithm gains the capacity to adaptively keep step sizes up for\n          those weights which have reliably, through those changes in the\n          gradient, kept being changed in a signifigant way. Expanding out the\n          term for {` \\( E[x] \\) `} we get the formula:{\" \"}\n          {`\\\\[ E[x]_n =\n              (1-\\\\rho)\\\\rho^{n-1} g^2_0 + (1-\\\\rho)\\\\rho^{n-2} g^2_1 + ... +\n              (1-\\\\rho)g_n^2 \\\\]`}{\" \"}\n          showing that (given that {`\\(rho < 1 \\)`} past gradients gradually are\n          scaled down in relevance to the current update rule as they're\n          weighting in the full running sum is slowly decrease timestep by\n          timestep).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          AdaDelta definingly maintains two running momentums, one for which\n          weights have been changing consistently and another for how steep the\n          gradient was been over time. Keeping these dual momentums allows\n          AdaDelta to adjust step sizes to be cautious in regions of high\n          gradients regardless of the signs of those gradients (allowing\n          traversals out of local pitfalls and dampening oscillations in the\n          vertical directions) while preserving room for individual weights to\n          update (or not update) according to what their individual running\n          momentums call for.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          One of the key applications of this algorithm is in cases of models\n          with many weights where some weights may be exercised only sparsely\n          during training, through dampening the updates of weights which occur\n          more often in comparison to weights which have rarer distinct\n          gradients, the update rule compensates to make larger adjustments to\n          those weights which rarely show up as relevant compared to those let's\n          say\n          <i>overexposed</i> weights, this allows for a higher proportional\n          consideration of those niche weights which filters down into higher\n          performance on the deep networks which we see everywhere nowadays.\n          AdaDelta has been shown to work well on the 2nd and 3rd challenging\n          valley shapes for optimizers, to take minimially more computation than\n          pure gradient descent, to be robust to dramatic gradients, noise, and\n          a good degree of network choices, all without need for a learning rate\n          ({`\\(\\\\eta \\)`}) hyperparameter!\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          There are a few further SGD-Type optimizers which pop up sporadically\n          in the literature:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            {`\\(L^2 \\)`} regularized SGD (SGDW) which decreases the weight\n            additionally based on the scale of that weight, ideally to prevent\n            overfitting, but which often falls down through mucking the signal\n            for actual accuracy convergence.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            SGD with Projection (SGDP) which hypothetically minimizes weight\n            updates in the direction of increasing the norm of the weights (aka\n            regularizing the weights) but which only performs slighly above\n            SGDW.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            and Quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) which uses a weighted sum of\n            pure SGD and a SGD model using momentum and in the process achieves\n            higher avoidance of local minimums over SGD but still falls into the\n            traps of the SGD with momentum models, achieving an unhappy medium.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n          Overall, there's a broad family of optimizers built off the core of\n          SGD which develop on each other in very interesting ways to observe\n          and avoid the pitfalls which the naive SGD algorithm falls into.\n          Howevever, there's another family of first-order optimizers outside of\n          the SGD-Type variants which has risen to dominance this past decade,\n          displacing SGD-Type optimizers and opening up another exciting front\n          in the field of optimizer design...\n        </p>\n\n        <h4 id=\"adam-type\">Adam-Type</h4>\n\n        <p>\n          <b>Adaptive Moment (Adam) </b> optimizers expand the scope of\n          information being tracked to consider two \"moment\" views from the\n          trail of past observed gradients, both of which utilize AdaGrad's\n          method of exponentially decaying summation and together provide the\n          optimizer the ability to account for simultaneously the jaggedness of\n          gradient change & standardness of direction of that gradient change.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>The following is the formula for Adam:</p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\begin{gather} &M_t = \\\\beta_1 M_{t-1} + (1-\\\\beta_1)g_t \\\\\\\\ &V_t =\n          \\\\beta_2 V_{t-1} + (1-\\\\beta_2)g_t^2 \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ &\\\\hat M_t = M_t / (1-\\\\beta_1^t)\n          \\\\\\\\ &\\\\hat V_t = V_t / (1-\\\\beta_2^t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ &\\\\theta_{t+1} = \\\\theta_t - \\\\eta\n          \\\\frac{\\\\hat M_t}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\hat V_t}+\\\\epsilon} \\\\end{gather} \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          The first moment which Adam takes care to compile is the\n          <i>mean</i> ({`\\(\\\\hat M_t \\)`}) of the past gradients, which is\n          generally taken to imply when a long string of gradients has been\n          pointing in the same direction. The second moment which Adam compiles\n          is the <i>variance</i> ({`\\(\\\\hat V_t \\)`}) of the gradient, aka a\n          running sum of the square of the gradients, isolating the steepness of\n          the slope our model is traversing at the expense of preserving the\n          exact average direction of those slopes. This is really a quite smart\n          design, breaking out two momentum terms where each informs tracks what\n          information the other is leaving aside, aka the consistency of the\n          direction of the gradients and the jaggedness of those gradients.\n          Through this design Adam's family of optimizers opens up room for\n          considering a variety of different function regions.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The final adaptation which Adam institutes over SGD-Type models which\n          warrants explanation is this bias-correction division of both moments.\n          As we showed in our explanation of AdaDelta one of the characteristics\n          of these exponentially decaying summations is that, in the case of the\n          first moment for example, at any given time \\`t \\` unrolling \\`M_t \\`\n          into how much each \\`M_i \\` term is being considered in \\`M_t \\` gives\n          us the following formula:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ M_t = \\\\beta_1^{t}M_0 + \\\\beta_1^{t-1}(1-\\\\beta_1)M_1 + ... +\n          (1-\\\\beta_1)M_{t-1} \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          Since ({`\\( \\beta_1 \\)`}) and ({`\\( \\beta_2 \\)`}) are usually set to\n          values (\n          {`\\( \\approx\n            1 \\)`}\n          ), the terms {` \\(1-\\beta_1 \\)`} and {` \\(1-\\beta_2 \\)`} becomes{\" \"}\n          {`\\( \\approx 0\n            \\)`}{\" \"}\n          dragging the value of ({`\\(M_t \\)`}) to towards zero at very small \\`t\n          \\` values and causing early updates to, without correction,\n          overaccount for early moments. This is the origin of those (\n          {`\\( \\hat M_t \\)`}) and (\n          {`\\( \\hat V_t\n            \\)`}\n          ) terms: {`\\(1 - \\\\beta_1^t \\)`} blows up the value of {`\\(M_t \\)`}{\" \"}\n          when \\`t \\` is small and gradually converges to value of one as \\`t \\`\n          approaches ({`\\( \\infty \\)`}) meaning that the value of{\" \"}\n          {`\\(\\frac{M_t}{1-\\\\beta_1^t} \\)`}\n          adaptivelys scale up the value of {`\\(M_t \\)`} earlier into it's\n          training (with the same logic carrying over to {`\\( \\hat V_t \\)`}).\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Finally in place of the usual gradient term in SGD, Adam uses the\n          ratio between that general direction being pointed to over the mean of\n          the past gradients divided by the square root (as a normalizing tool)\n          of the variance in the jaggedness of those gradients. This ratio\n          allows for larger steps in regions of consistently directional\n          gradients on top of a cautionary dampening when the gradients are\n          jagged and might be taking our model in more dramatic directions if\n          followed fully. Adam can famously solve all 3 example valley shapes\n          (Ackley, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) as it's exponential moving averages\n          (EMA) together decreases propensity to fall into local minimums and\n          open up adaptability to a wide range of different surface dynamics.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          I briefly mentioned {`\\(L^2 \\)`} regularized SGD (aka SGDW) as an\n          out-there iteration of the SGD family of first-order optimizers. SGDW\n          aspired to decreasing overfitting but failed through mucking up the\n          update signal, hurting convergence more than it served to improve\n          generalization. Well one of the benefits of the Adam formulation of\n          optimization over SGD is that the self-regularizing version of Adam\n          has actually managed to live up to those hopes! Enter the most popular\n          spin off of the Adam class of optimizers: AdamW.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The following is the formula for <b>AdamW</b>:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\theta_t = \\\\theta_{t-1} - \\\\eta \\\\left[\\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\hat m_t}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\hat\n          v_t}+\\\\epsilon} + \\\\lambda \\\\theta_t \\\\right] \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          At it's core: AdamW integrates the scale of each weight being updated\n          into determining how much to adjust that weight by, decreasing each\n          weight by ({`\\( \\eta \\\\lambda \\\\theta \\)`}) at each step and dragging\n          all weights closer to value around zero which propensity to take on a\n          lopsided weight combination for overfitting to the exact problem our\n          model is being trained on. AdamW's inserted weight reduction\n          consideration has been shown empirically to provide better gains in\n          generalization than just slapping the traditional {`\\(L^2 \\)`}{\" \"}\n          Regularizer on top of traditional Adam and has gained real popularity\n          in-industry for its ability to guarantee reliable model performance.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          One of the downfalls of AdamW is that it's {`\\(L^2 \\)`} Regularization\n          drives convergence in the global minimum neighborhood to not be as\n          smooth as necessary, often bumping around the true solution. One of\n          the solutions to this is to look back to Nesterov momentum from the\n          SGD family and bring it into the Adam algorithm, resulting in the\n          following update rule, titled <b>NAdam</b>:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\theta_{t+1} = \\\\theta_t - \\\\frac{\\\\eta}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\hat v_t}+\\\\epsilon}\n          \\\\left(\\\\beta_1 \\\\hat m_t + \\\\frac{(1-\\\\beta_1)g_t}{1-\\\\beta_1^t}\\\\right) \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          As you can see, NAdam adds a small partial step of\n          {`\\(\\frac{(1-\\\\beta_1)g_t}{1-\\\\beta_1^t} \\)`} into Adam and while this\n          yields some additional performance (especially on training deep\n          convolutional NNs) through speedier convergence from a smoother update\n          rule capable of further considering the convexity of the problem\n          surface. NAdam is common in industry in it's own right for trading a\n          slightly higher proclivity to overfit compared to AdamW for a bit of\n          better convergence. Unfortunately NAdam has been known to begin to\n          stack up deviations from the ideal on more complicated\n          physics-informed models used to learn complex PDEs.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Into that space enters <b>Rectified Adam (RAdam)</b> which introduces\n          another trick in evening out extreme behavior through an additional\n          term aimed at rectifying the variance in our adaptive learning rate\n          and in the process provoking more reliable returned updates and higher\n          test accuracies.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>The algorithm for RAdam is as follows:</p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\begin{gather} &\\\\rho_t = \\\\rho_{\\\\infty} - 2t\\\\beta_2^t/(1-\\\\beta_2^t) \\\\\\\\\n          &\\\\rho_{\\\\infty} = \\\\frac{2}{1-\\\\beta_2} - 1 \\\\end{gather} \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          If the variance is tractable (which works out to ({`\\(\\rho_t > 4 \\)`}\n          )) then the adaptive learning rate and subsequent update rule becomes:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\begin{gather} &l_t = \\\\sqrt{(1-\\\\beta_2^t)/v_t} \\\\\\\\ &r_t =\n          \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(\\\\rho_t - 4)(\\\\rho_t -\n          2)\\\\rho_{\\\\infty}}{(\\\\rho_{\\\\infty}-4)(\\\\rho_{\\\\infty}-2)\\\\rho_t}} \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\n          &\\\\theta_t = \\\\theta_{t-1} - \\\\eta_t r_t \\\\hat m_t l_t \\\\end{gather} \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          Else, when the variance isn't tractable the update rule is simplified\n          to a naive adam update rule:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\theta_t = \\\\theta_{t-1} - \\\\eta_t \\\\hat m_t \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>RAdam's core innovation is the additon of:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            {`\\(\\rho \\)`} as an approximation of the center of mass of the EMA\n            guiding the Adam update rule, and,\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            an {`\\(r_t \\)`} term for evening out the variance in the adaptive\n            learning rate over the course of training.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n          The authors of RAdam observed when introducing the algorithm that due\n          to the lack of samples at early stages in training Adam has an\n          undesirably large variance in step sizes which can drive it into\n          suspicious / bad local optima (this is the whole origin for the{\" \"}\n          {`\\( \\hat m_t\n            \\)`}{\" \"}\n          and {`\\( \\hat v_t \\)`} corrective factors in the first place).

Additionally\n          there are other optimizers which outperform RAdam on minimizing error\n          rates faster and reaching better accuracies after training, one being\n          DiffGrad.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <b>DiffGrad</b> introduces the concept of <i>friction</i> through\n          building a {`\\( xi_t \\)`} term which enforces higher parameter updates\n          in regions with higher changes in the gradient across steps,\n          essentially adjusting the learning rate according to how much the\n          local gradient regions shape calls for dynamic learning rate\n          adjustments.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The update rule is much simpler than RAdam and thus follows the update\n          ruel for DiffGrad:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\begin{gather} &\\\\Delta g_t = g_{t-1} - g_t \\\\\\\\ &\\\\xi_t =\n          \\\\frac{1}{1+e^{-|\\\\Delta g_t|}} \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ &\\\\theta_{t+1} = \\\\theta_t -\n          \\\\frac{\\\\eta_t \\\\xi_t \\\\hat m_t}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\hat v_t}+\\\\epsilon} \\\\end{gather} \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          DiffGrad is capable of traversing all three of our optimizer\n          challenging functions and can very reliably both keep the learning\n          rate higher when far from the optimum and accurately avoid\n          overshooting through lowering the learning rate when closer to the\n          optimum. DiffGrad performs very well on deep convolutional networks\n          much like RAdam while still preserving the theoretical advantages on\n          our chosen challenge function shapes. DiffGrad also has some evidence\n          pointing to it outperforming SGDM, AdaDelta, and Adam on a wide range\n          of pattern recognition challenges.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          DiffGrad does end out being a bit overtuned to solving simply\n          classical and convolutional neural networks however and (to be fair,\n          much like all of the First-Order optimizers) shows marked collapse in\n          learning on more complex NNs. When analyzed on the quantum, spiked,\n          complex-valued, and physics-informed networks which all optimizers\n          should aspire to be able to cover in addition to the usual\n          convolutional, reccurent, and traditional NNs it too failed to show\n          efficient. Another Adam-Type optimizer was soon proposed after\n          DiffGrad which takes more account of the curvature of the loss\n          function during minimization, Yogi.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <b>Yogi</b> relies on scaling the gradient by the square root of the\n          EMA of past gradients to control the effective learning rate and led\n          to even better performance with those same theoretic guarantees on\n          convergence, in many ways solving the convergence failure in simple\n          convex optimization settings which composed the primary weakness of\n          Adam-type optimizers.

In this way the\n          Adam family shows tremendous durability in applying to the large\n          models dominating the in-industry investments which is why they are\n          the go-to names today in most projects.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The core innovation of the Adam family is the introduction of this\n          dual moment (mean and variance) dynamic and as you may have noticed,\n          all of the Adam optimizers I've shown so far have stuck to that 2\n          moment structure. However, importantly, there is a field of\n          interesting optimizers which expand out into 3 moments under\n          consideration at any given time which would probably still be\n          categorized under the Adam family of optimizers.\n        </p>\n\n        <h5 id=\"triple-moment\">Triple Moment Adam-Type Optimizers</h5>\n\n        <p>\n          The first of two major concepts worth explaining as a form of\n          expanding momentum out into multiple moments is the concept of\n          positive-negative momentum or as I would maybe prefer it to be named:\n          odd-even momentum. As described by\n          <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.17182\">Xie et Al. 2022</a> the\n          usual EMA of gradients{\" \"}\n          {`\\(m_t = \\sum_{k=0}^t (1-\\beta_1)\\beta_1^{t-k}g_k \\)`} can be\n          expanded into two EMAs roughly tracking the even-{`\\(t\\)`} gradients\n          and odd-{`\\(t\\)`} gradients respectively in the following formula:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\[ \\begin{gather} &m_t = (1 + \\beta_0)m_t^{(odd)} + \\beta_0m_t^{(even)} =\n          \\\\ \\\\\n          &(1-\\beta_0)\\left(\\sum_{k=1,3,...t}(1-\\beta_1)\\beta_1^{t-k}g_k\\right) +\n          \\beta_0\\left(\\sum_{k=0,2,...t}(1-\\beta_1)\\beta_1^{t-k}g_k\\right)\n          \\end{gather} \\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          This is meaningful insight is that now we've introduced a new (\n          {`\\( \\beta_0\n            \\)`}\n          ) variable which can be tuned to grind out the noise between both\n          momentum terms leaving our optimizer with a more realistic and lower\n          variance view of the surface it's descending along. Evnetually this\n          leads into the first triple moment Adam-Type optimizer, AdaPNM which\n          uses the following update rule:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\begin{gather} &m_t = \\\\beta_1^2m_{t-2} + (1-\\\\beta_1^2)g_t \\\\\\\\ &\\\\hat m_t\n          = \\\\frac{(1+\\\\beta_0)m_t - \\\\beta_0m_{t-1}}{1-\\\\beta_1^t} \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ &v_t =\n          \\\\beta_2v_{t-1} + (1-\\\\beta_2)g_t^2 \\\\\\\\ &\\\\hat v_t = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{max}(v_t,\n          v_{\\\\text{max}})}{1-\\\\beta_2^t} \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ &\\\\theta_{t+1} = \\\\theta_t - \\\\frac{\\\\eta\n          \\\\cdot \\\\hat m_t}{\\\\sqrt{(1+\\\\beta_0)^2+\\\\beta_0^2}} \\\\end{gather} \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          As you can see, AdaPNM preserves the variance moment but essentially\n          breaks the mean moment into two seperate momentum terms for the odd\n          and even timesteps independently existing within the {`\\(m_t \\)`}{\" \"}\n          history and being weighted against eachother in the {`\\( \\hat m_t \\)`}{\" \"}\n          formula. AdaPNM has been shown on deep NNs to give higher test\n          accuracies than advanced double moment Adam optimizers like Yogi and\n          AdaBelief but is only one of the two relevant triple-moment\n          optimizers, the second being another\n          <i>Nesterov</i> influenced momentum formulation in, Adan, which has\n          the following algorithm:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\begin{gather} &m_t = (1-\\\\beta_0)m_{t-1} + \\\\beta_0g_t \\\\\\\\ &v_t =\n          (1-\\\\beta_1)v_{t-1} + \\\\beta_1(g_t-g_{t-1}) \\\\\\\\ &n_t = (1-\\\\beta_2)n_{t-1} +\n          \\\\beta_2[g_t + (1-\\\\beta_1)(g_t-g_{t-1})]^2 \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ &\\\\eta_t =\n          \\\\frac{\\\\eta}{\\\\sqrt{n_t + \\\\epsilon}} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\theta_{t+1} = (1+\\\\lambda\n          \\\\eta)^{-1} \\\\bigg[\\\\theta_t - \\\\eta_t(m_t + (1-\\\\beta_1)v_t) \\\\bigg]\n          \\\\end{gather} \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          As you can see, Adan essentially keeps a EMA for the gradient term, a\n          EMA for the change in the gradient term, and a third EMA for roughly\n          where each element in each EMA would have placed the subsequent\n          gradient which is used to scale the learning rate applied for updating\n          (\n          {`\\( \\theta\n            \\)`}\n          ).\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"../../public/assets/pics/Advanced_optimizations_Saddle.gif\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-med\"\n          />\n          <p className=\"small-text responsive-text-med\">\n            Quick animation I whipped up, inspired by the\n            <a href=\"https://github.com/luisdamed/Gradient_Descent_Visualizations/blob/main/Advanced_Gradient_Descent_Trajectories.ipynb\">\n              Luisdamed's Gradient Descent Visualization notebook\n            </a>{\" \"}\n            comparing the performance of a few select First-order SGD and Adam\n            type optimizers\n            <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_nQEYD2D-b3wnuSb5bYZ2zYh1-KVyllo?usp=sharing\">\n              (Colab)\n            </a>\n            .\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          That settles the full account of the general standouts in the field of\n          First-Order optimizers. Phew! First-Order optimizers are extremely\n          well suited for pattern recognition, time-series prediction, and\n          object classifiction which is why they absolutely dominate so much of\n          the day-to-day models being implemented in-industry as that has been\n          where the majority of applicability has been found. First-Order\n          optimizers high-signal moving averages and measurements of physical\n          moments traced over multiple steps to avoid costly measurments of the\n          actual surface being traversed, avoiding the cost of clearing the fog\n          over the valley. In exchange First-Order optimizers unlock extremely\n          speedy execution time with less power per iteration. The primary issue\n          however with First-Order optimizers is that with very few exceptions\n          (basically just AdaPNM & Adan on select architectures) they fail to\n          improve accuracy on more complex NN architectures like Graph,\n          Complex-valued, and Quantum NNs and fail to encapsulate the\n          second-order dynamics which predominate Physics-Informed NNs. This\n          opens the door in academic & research settings to the second major\n          category of optimizers: Second-Order Optimizers!\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 id=\"second-order\">Second-Order Optimizers</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          The fundamental weakness of First-Order Optimizers is that they can\n          only put together so detailed of a view of the surface their\n          descending when the only information they have to go off of is a set\n          of disparate gradients.

Quasi-Newtonian\n          optimizers like Apollo and AdaHessian have found some applications for\n          their higher convergence as practical choices on standard\n          convolutional NNs and recurrent networks where time and/or power\n          consumption isn't as critical. Both Newtonian (L-BFGS / SR1) and\n          Quasi-Newtonian (Apollo / AdaHessian) have also been found to show\n          superior results over First-order options particularly on\n          Physics-Informed NNs (PINNs) where one needs to analyze the loss\n          function as well as initial and boundary conditions. Unfortunately, on\n          more complicated NNs and much of the giant LLMs of today the higher\n          time consumption becomes prohibitive in comparison to any benefits in\n          convergence which moving from First to Second-order optimizers might\n          yield. In many ways the story of Second-Order optimizers is the same\n          story which optimizers as a field comes up against over and over, that\n          being the fundamental challenge of optimizer design: how to\n          encapsulate better geometric reasoning (aka better convergence on\n          complex landscapes) into less effort. This leads us to our third and\n          final category of optimization algorithms, one which brings in a few\n          heavier techniques in geometry, probability, and optimization to try\n          and reformulate the problem in terms easier to compute across,\n          Information-Geometric terms.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 id=\"info-geometric\">Information-Geometric Optimizers</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          Information geometry is formulation of model fitting as a decision of\n          which parameters to choose from a family of parametric models and in\n          the field of Information-Geometric optimizers there are two main\n          choices which stick out as meaningfully different: Natural Gradient\n          Descent and Mirror Descent.\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"centered-item-holder\">\n          <img\n            src=\"../../public/assets/pics/Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 2.27.36â€¯PM.png\"\n            alt=\"\"\n            className=\"responsive-image-med\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          Natural Gradient Descent describes the following set-up for that\n          parametric selection.

Under this formulation gradient flow for optimization entails\n          searching for a change in\n          {`\\(\\theta_t \\)`} which would lead to better improvement in the\n          objective value controlled for the length of the change in terms of\n          the geometry of the manifold, working out to the following formula:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\frac{d\\\\theta (t)}{dt}= -g(\\\\theta, \\\\theta + d\\\\theta)^{-1}\\\\nabla\n          f(\\\\theta(t)) \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          Where under the standard Euclidean manifold metric, where{\" \"}\n          {`\\(g = I \\)`}, the gradient flow reduces to gradient descent but\n          under under a probability distribution manifold with K-L divergence as\n          a metric you get the beginnings of a formulation of quantum neural\n          networks. Additionally, if you extand that Rimannian manifold with a\n          Levi-Civita connection to conjugate the manifolds, you get a conjugate\n          connection manifold, a particular case of divergence manifolds where\n          using direct K-L Divergence comes out to a natural gradient descent\n          formula of:\n        </p>\n\n        <p>{`\\\\[ \\\\theta_{t+1} = \\\\theta_t - \\\\eta_t F^{-1}(\\\\theta)\\\\nabla f(\\\\theta) \\\\]`}</p>\n\n        <p>\n          Where {`\\(g(\\\\theta, \\\\theta+d\\\\theta) = F(\\\\theta_t) \\)`} is the\n          Fisher information matrix.
