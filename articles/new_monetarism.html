        <h3>Reading the Error Message</h3>

        <p>
            Four weeks ago, the American people went to the polls and voted to remove the Biden 
            administration, returning Donald Trump to the Oval Office and the position of 
            Commander in Chief. This has been the most consequential and upsetting election 
            result of my lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the wake of this <u>disaster</u>, the atmosphere feels markedly different from that 
            of 2016. Back then, fiery reactions of resistance and horror erupted from the 
            liberal masses. Now, however, the response is <i>very</i> different. 
            I'm seeing a transformation within the liberal intelligentsia-- 
            a shift toward <i>depressive</i> self-doubt. Vibrant democratic thought 
            withdraws amidst it's defeat, conceding it's rejection by the American 
            people in favor of the MAGA movement. We try to grapple with the 
            immense question of how to craft a constructive narrative of the 
            American dream that can reconcile our understanding of ourselves and the
            failures which lead to this man's re-election by the popular majority. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Why, how, could they have preferred that man after everything the Biden
            Administration had done? More importantly, should this be taken as a 
            fundamental rejection of the ability of the way of governing Biden
            represented to survive politically, is Trumpist politics and illiberalism
            the superior model, or is there some way to articulate within the language of 
            Liberalism a path forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are witnessing sparks of a long-overdue intellectual attempt to 
            locate, describe, and overcome whatever leads 10s of millions to reject liberal 
            America and turn to a man like that. A repudiation of Bidenomics and the Democratic 
            coalition's agenda in its entirety, this time, by the democratic will.
        </p>
        <p>
            And I'm here to answer those questions :>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Just kidding,,, üí¢‚ùóÔ∏è</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            But I'd at the very least like to discuss those questions a bit in this
            public space for venting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amidst the tension, I feel that some of the strongest arguments explaining why 
            the Democrats were so thoroughly rejected boil down to issues of macroeconomic 
            reality. The arguments generally proceed as follows: A whipsaw of society 
            reopening after COVID-19, brittle globalized supply chains, and built-up consumer 
            savings gluts caused trillions of dollars to flood into a restricted supply pool. 
            This surge led to inflation spiking and price levels increasing by some 
            <a
                href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/latest-inflation-statistics/">
                20 percent since 2020
            </a>. Such unprecedented rises in price levels have inspired fury 
            among voters across the board in one of the most election-dense years in human 
            history. Universally leading to voters having elected to throw out their ruling parties, 
            pointing the finger at them for the real pain of these economic conditions.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I should express now, before beginning to build my narrative, the great 
            postmodern caveat that I am aware and in large part preoccupied with how there
            are important aspects of how this election played out which this narrative overlooks.
            The media environment and the failure to conduct a proper presidential primary process 
            are, in my mind, the primary missing pieces. <i>Nonetheless</i>, I think 
            the overall narrative is correct up to a point.

            I don't think this is solely about COVID-19 üò∑. I think the pandemic was 
            the catalyst that revealed a cost-of-living crisis arising from an intersection 
            of failures within liberal institutions that have been left unaddressed for 
            quite some time now. The veneer of a decade-and-a-half-long, globalization-induced 
            zero-inflation landscape has been cast off. The American people are seeing the 
            direction in which society is moving in liberal America and have recognized the 
            need for change. I happen to agree, and I believe there are some compelling 
            reasons to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Liberal America is failing to understand <u>economic reality</u> and the experiences
            of real economic anxiety at front of mind for the American people. In order 
            to explain this I felt it would be an interesting exercise to explore the 
            history behind how we arrived at the development of the mainstream economic 
            schools of today as well as some of the more iconoclastic schools that have 
            been gaining traction outside the halls of academia, one of which I happen 
            to give a whole lot of stock as explaining how the economy has expanded in 
            complexity beyond what our archaic models properly modelled. Trying to 
            articulate <b>with theory</b>, the ghost in the machine pointing all our 
            indicators of how we would project the American people to be perceiving 
            their economic well-being off from the reality.

        <h3>Stepping Through...</h3>

        <p>
            The very first theory of economics was ‚ú®Adam Smith‚ú®'s school of Classical Economics,
            also known as laissez-faire economics. Under this framework, markets were seen as 
            self-regulating through the invisible hand of self-interest, and government was 
            advised to take as minimal a role in the economy as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Classical Economics dominated academic thought up until the Great Depression, 
            which seemed to prove that free markets could, in fact, in and of themselves
            bring about truly deep and prolonged dysfunction. Dynamics of extended mass 
            unemployment and fears of economic stagnation began to boil over. In response, 
            the ideas of Keynesianism rose alongside the guns of a big New Deal American 
            government, which endorsed and seemed to validate its ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the Keynesian School of Economics, it was argued that the government 
            should be the rational actor to <i>smooth</i> over the highs and lows of business 
            cycles. This meant the government providing active support to the economy in 
            times of economic breakdown and saving, cooling the economy, in times of sustained 
            economic growth. Keynesians 
            didn't necessarily argue against the long-term wisdom of the invisible hand of 
            the free market, but they rebuked it with the now-famous assertion that "in the 
            long run, we are all dead." They contended that the government cannot let people 
            live in squalor today for the sake of a not obviously forthcoming well-off future. 
            Short-run failures of the market needed to be righted to put the economy back on 
            track in the short term.
        </p>
        <p>
            The government, as an economic actor itself, could step in when aggregate demand 
            collapsed. As the sole holder of rights to print money, it could create money to 
            spend in the economy and bring economic activity back up to healthy levels. 
            Keynesianism aligned itself with a revision of Classical Economics known as 
            Neoclassical Economics, which incorporated new theoretical progress in rational 
            choice theory. This highlighted the importance of government in controlling 
            economic agents' expectations through policy posturing, which would influence 
            the state of things going forward and encourage differing views of the future 
            that impact current behavior. Together, Keynesian and Neoclassical tools of 
            supply and demand formed what is known as the Neoclassical Synthesis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, come the 1970s, in an America with the Great Depression far in 
            its rearview mirror, a new economic syndrome began to show its face‚Äîone which 
            Keynesianism proved unable to address. This spawned yet another new era of 
            economic thought: Monetarism, as well as a splinter faction in the form of the 
            Austrian School of Economics.
        </p>

        <p>
            Going into the 1970s, the U.S. government was already stimulating the economy 
            heavily due to poor rates of productivity increases. Then, OPEC‚Äîthe cartel of 
            oil-producing countries‚Äîembargoed the United States, causing inflation to 
            skyrocket. An inflationary cycle took place where workers demanded higher wages 
            to keep up with inflation, and in return, businesses passed the increased labor 
            costs onto consumers, creating a self-reinforcing spiral. Economic growth was 
            low, and inflation was high, directly challenging Keynesianism's call for 
            stimulus in times of inflation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The government could not stimulate it's way out of the chaos, in fact, in some ways
            it had stimulated it's way <i>into</i> the chaos. This called into question 
            whether even the government could be seen to be able to know when to 
            prudently cut back versus stimulate in the national economy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A crisis into which the Monetarist school rose with a theory centered around 
            the supply of money and an increased importance of the Federal Reserve in 
            regulating the national economy. Under the Monetarist framework, the money 
            supply was the unifying pool into which all levers of government fed to control 
            the economy. The Federal Reserve, as the sole institution empowered to print 
            U.S. dollars, became the most important economic actor in town outside Congress.

        <p>
            Monetarists maintained the theory of economic cycles from Keynesianism and built
            upon it, rearticulating a vision for how the government could more directly measure 
            the health of the economy and a lever to pull for increasing or decreasing stimulation 
            of the economy to counteract the business cycles. Monetarists argued, convincingly, 
            that inflation is the product of the supply of money growing faster 
            than the bucket of real economic output being purchased with that money. 
            They described inflation mathematically under the formula:
        </p>
        <p>
            \( MV=PQ \), where \(M\) is the money supply, \(V\) is the velocity of money, \(P\) is the 
            price level, and \(Q\) is real output. Monetarists argued that the Federal Reserve 
            could reduce inflation through tools explicitly designed to decrease the amount 
            of money flowing through the economy.
        </p>
        <p>
            A natural rate of unemployment was defined, and a correlation established between the
            money supply and the inflation consumers were experiencing in front of their eyes. 
            Alongside a new, strict, Federal Reserve chairmanship under Paul Volcker who subscribed to this 
            new Monetarist school. He spiked interest rates to cool down economic activity, 
            causing not only the recession of the early 1980s but also the successful 
            curtailment of the inflation spiral that the school had risen to address.
        </p>
        <p>
            Simultaneously, guided by desires to counteract the Cold War tendencies toward 
            central planning‚Äîwhich existed in the USSR at the time and were seen by many in 
            the Monetarist school‚Äîthe Austrian School of Economics grew. It rejected this
            activist Federal Reserve, pointing the finger at the governments attempts to 
            smooth out the business cycle as the exact source of the economic cycles of booms 
            and busts it was trying to solve in the first place. The Austrian School took issue with the entire 
            project of Monetarism by arguing that its attempt to treat the money supply as 
            something controllable by government policy was an inherently flawed departure 
            from the tie that currency should have to the physical commodities to which they 
            had historically been pegged (such as the gold standard). Arguing that the 
            government destroys coordination in the economy when it meddles with that 
            ratio & signal of economic reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Austrian Economics supported deregulation of the banking sector and minimalist 
            monetary intervention, describing business cycles as natural phenomena where 
            government intervention only serves to prolong economic problems that represent 
            the working through of market adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
            This combined into the neoliberal equilibrium of <b>Supply-Side Economics</b>. While 
            the Federal Reserve would manage monetary policy‚Äîthe supply of money‚Äîthe rest 
            of the government was handling fiscal policy. Arguments that economic activity 
            was being stymied by excessive taxation began to dominate . Taxes were slashed as 
            well as the social policies they funded in favor of the belief that businesses 
            would use the extra money to invest efficiently into boosting economic output. Case in 
            point the infamous Laffer Curve.

        <p>
            This is the point at which the modern rejections of economics as a field in its 
            entirety, which I see everywhere around me‚Äîboth at my university and among my 
            generation as a whole‚ÄîI believe owe their roots. But it wasn't until the 
            financial crisis of 2008 that these misunderstandings truly came to light.
        </p>
        <p>
            The financial crisis of 2008 highlighted that there was more to economic 
            collapse than mismanagement of the supply of money. Supply-Side Economics had 
            deregulated its way into a situation where a few systemically important banks 
            took on excessive internal leverage, engaged in risky lending, and indulged in 
            greed-fueled speculation to manufacture imaginary bubbles of economic growth 
            detached from reality and bound to eventually pop. Economic thought began to 
            understand that certain private organizations had grown to become 
            <b>"too big to fail"</b> 
            and that neither the Monetarist school had the conceptual tools to tackle 
            the shortfalls of financial mismanagement nor could the Austrian method of 
            letting the free market fail be allowed to drag the global economy into its 
            greatest crisis since the Great Depression.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old Keynesian adage that...
            <p class="old-timey">"In the long run, we are all dead"</p> was not 
            as dead as the Austrian School may have wished and something needed to be 
            done to prevent the market from walking itself into a crisis like this
            again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Out of this grew entirely new fields of economics. One was <i>Behavioral Economics</i>, 
            which analyzed the psychological dynamics behind how humans act irrationally and 
            how that translates into unhealthy market equilibriums and financial bubbles. 
            Another was <i>Post-Keynesian Theory</i>, which built on Hyman Minsky's Financial 
            Instability Hypothesis to describe how stability breeds instability through 
            increased risk-taking in financial markets. This emphasized the role of 
            financial markets in influencing the supply of money as the source of credit 
            within the economy, essentially providing a synthesis of the Monetarist and 
            Austrian schools of thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            Post-Keynesianism subsumed Monetarism as the theoretical grounding for its 
            endogenous money supply while articulating new tools for measuring the 
            financial industry as a source of an exogenous money multiplier. In the decade 
            and a half after 2008, during which I was growing up, we saw a process of 
            globalization that caused wage growth to slow and prices to fall as supply 
            chains became more efficient. This efficiency was achieved by utilizing global 
            competitive advantages and economies of scale alongside digitalization, which 
            reduced costs across the economy through efficiencies and better information for 
            consumer goods. Aging demographics also slowed consumer spending.

            This translated into job loss and extremely low levels of inflation, which the 
            Federal Reserve managed through a 15-year regime of near-zero interest rates. 
            It wasn't until the storm of reopening after COVID-19‚Äîwhere globalized supply 
            chains proved far more difficult to logistically restart and trillions flowed 
            back into the market‚Äîthat the Federal Reserve actually had to pivot to 
            controlling inflation. While experts would tell you that they have largely done 
            a good job at this‚Äîwith inflation back down and unemployment actually below 
            what Monetarist underpinnings tell us it should be‚Äîpeople had also forgotten 
            what it feels like to see inflation and responded with fury.

        <h3>Debugging üêû</h3>

        <p>
            Much like in the 1980s and 2008, I see two main new schools of heterodox economic 
            thought that have been evolving under the surface of the current establishment 
            of economic theory. I don't necessarily agree with these theories‚Äîthe first one 
            I'll introduce I'm even fairly sure is very wrong‚Äîbut I think they're both 
            interesting as a way to dig into some of the freshest ground where issues are 
            being raised with the current way of doing economic thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first theory I would mention is <i>Modern Monetary Theory</i> (MMT). While Austrian 
            Economics critiqued the Monetarist school by arguing against the idea of 
            governments' ability to institute fiat currency‚Äîclaiming that the value of money 
            is based on the physical commodity to which it is tied‚ÄîModern Monetary Theory 
            builds on the chartalist view of money. Chartalism describes the value of money 
            as arising not from some pegging to a physical commodity of specific value but 
            instead from the exclusive right of the government to levy taxes on economic 
            activity. This legitimizes that country's currency as the exclusive medium for 
            valuing all of the economic activity within its borders.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chartalism shows its fingerprints in much of early economics, from Adam Smith 
            and Jean-Baptiste Say to John Stuart Mill and even Karl Marx. Today, MMT has 
            risen back to popularity largely as a justification for raising taxation to 
            fund government expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern Monetary Theory claims that the primary path to full employment is 
            through fiscal policy rather than monetary policy, which is the mainstream 
            narrative. It describes the federal government as breathing value into its 
            currency, where fiscal spending is limited solely by inflation that happens when 
            real resources are being fully utilized‚Äîthat is, near full employment. MMT rose 
            to prominence in the modern era through shout-outs by politicians like Bernie 
            Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It has played a role in delegitimizing 
            fears of taking on debt denominated in one's own government's currency, 
            promoting fiscal spending, and pushing for active federal programs to encourage 
            or directly provide employment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary critique of MMT lies in its overemphasis of the power of the 
            sovereign over its own currency‚Äîa point any ForEx trader would readily 
            point out to you. Not only do the values of currencies move based on demand for that 
            currency in international transactions or because of central bank rate arbitrage 
            opportunities, but borrowers largely depend on the stable value of currency in 
            order to loan in that currency. Anti-MMT critiques argue that undercutting this 
            dynamic threatens credit issuance across the economy, which dampens overall 
            economic activity and investment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another critique of MMT is that it may be better to put non-elected officials in 
            charge of handling macroeconomic fluctuations rather than elected politicians, 
            who are in many ways encouraged to overheat the economy to win short-term electoral 
            victories. The Federal government today, after all, does not seem like 
            the greatest of example of a long-term sustainable policy setup.
        </p>
        <p>
            This brings me to the second heterodox economic theory, about which I 
            dedicate many more words and which I think is very much worth discussing: 
            <i>Neo-Monetarist Economics</i>.
        </p>
        <div class="centered-item-holder">

        </div>
        <p>
            Neo-Monetarism grows out of the finance crowd and the economic ideas of 
            <b>Fisher Black</b> --one of the creators of the Black-Scholes model for financial markets 
            containing derivative investment instruments-- and <b>Eugene Fama</b>, an expert on 
            modern portfolio management theory. Much like how Post-Keynesianism incorporated 
            financial markets as an exogenous supply outside the direct endogenous M2 money 
            supply, Neo-Monetarism claims that the "supply of money" needs to be reimagined. 
            It envisions the economy exactly as you would imagine from a theorist grounded 
            in finance, a system fundamentally built on stocks of wealth, assets of different 
            forms and different liquidity being traded around with, often, money as the 
            intermediate step of transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the eyes of Neo-Monetarists, while money is <i>useful</i>, the core driver of the 
            growth of stocks of wealth and the amount of credit being issued from those 
            stocks is the <b>liquidity</b> of a huge swath of asset classes with varying <b>returns</b>. 
            Thus, the supply of money becomes some measure of the size of the total assets 
            being traded, adjusted for the liquidity of each of those assets. Debt and 
            equity become not mere additions and subtractions from the size of the economy 
            but, as beautifully shown in the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani‚ÄìMiller_theorem">Modigliani‚ÄìMiller theorem</a>, 
            two differently structured classes of capital to value economic enterprises by. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, while the old theory of Monetarism based on cash supply used to 
            be quite correct, today liquidity is jointly produced by the Federal Reserve 
            and the private market‚Äîwith the private market mattering more and more as the 
            field of financial instruments grows and the variety of financial instruments
            continues to be pushed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus the growth rate of the economy becomes much harder to model as it depends 
            on the exercising of non-uniform embedded options markets, although some starter 
            concepts within Fed circles on how to account for this difference discuss 
            reformulating the growth rate formula from being expressed in terms of the 
            sheer sum of M2 money supply sources
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisia_monetary_aggregates_index#:~:text=That%20approach%20to%20monetary%20aggregation,aggregates%20or%20Monetary%20Services%20Indexes.">[1]</a>:

            \[
            \Delta M_t = \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{jt} - \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{j(t-1)}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            To the weighted sum of all of the different asset classes being traded across the 
            economy (weighted by liquidity aka usefulness as a medium of exchange):

            \[
            \Delta \log M_t^D = \sum_{j=1}^n s_{jt}^* \left( \log x_{jt} - \log x_{j,t-1} \right),
            \]
            where each asset class is weighted according to it's share of expenditures averaged over 
            two periods of change:
            \[
            s_{jt}^* = \frac{1}{2} \left( s_{jt} + s_{j,t-1} \right),
            \quad s_{jt} = \frac{\pi_{jt} x_{jt}}{\sum_{k=1}^n \pi_{kt} x_{kt}},
            \]
            and 
            \[
            \pi_{jt} = \frac{R_t - r_{jt}}{1 + R_t},
            \]
            with \(R_t\) as the benchmark yield and \(r_{jt}\) the yield of the \(j\)th asset. Thus 
            making \(\pi_{jt} \) the opportunity cost of holding a unit's worth of the \(r_{jt}\)th 
            asset.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core problem being pointed to here is that it's becoming more and more 
            difficult to identify what indeed even is the <i>"money supply"</i>. A house, for 
            example, is pretty illiquid, but there's a chance you will choose to borrow against your 
            house, meaning that there's some factor of liquid credit correlating to that 
            asset besides the sheer value of selling the house, a multiplier dependent on the 
            structure of housing as an asset class and your preferences. An open and technically 
            difficult problem to solve, the point here is to say that currency is not nearly 
            as influential an asset pool in influencing the behavior of the market 
            as other asset classes and financial instability is felt not just in terms of 
            the stable value of the dollar but in terms of the stable value of and liquidity 
            of a variety of stocks of wealth heterogenously distributed across the US
            and it's society. In fact, most of the supply of physical cash isn't even 
            inside the United States, meaning that the behavior of cash in particular 
            may depend more on behavior in foreign economies or even just in illicit 
            markets like the drug trade, far more so than in other core asset classes which 
            perhaps represent the lever of the American asset stock allocation and growth 
            much more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some government levers could still be said to determine the money supply of course--  
            expectations of future economic behavior based on business conditions, historical precedent, 
            and the Federal Reserve's posturing-- but also things like private liquidity and 
            international relations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hope is that by <b>redefining</b> the supply of money to be more expansive, we can 
            then tease out a clearer signal of why it has been so hard to statistically 
            observe the relationship between the Fed's impression of the money supply and 
            the actual effects of their policies on economic behavior. Factors like the 
            success of the post-2008 Federal Reserve change to providing an interest rate on 
            bank reserves as opposed to their old explicit required amount of reserves 
            having driven the amount of bank reserves from billions into trillions overnight 
            shows that the economy and it's regulation ought to be viewed through the lens 
            of assets rather than hard currency being passed around between traders.
        </p>
        <p>
            One key policy takeaway of Neo-Monetarism is that the Federal Reserve is 
            actually far more underpowered than people currently understand it to be. The 
            role of banks as the sole source of lending by the Federal Reserve maybe ought to be 
            abandoned. Viewed through the lens of who is providing liquidity in the market, 
            banks shrink to only around 20 percent of the whole asset stock, and the rest of 
            the economy-- like the <i>insurance</i> industry, where the crisis of 2008 really 
            started --becomes far more important. Maybe quite the thing to consider 
            given the collapse in home insurance across the US from Climate Change and 
            in-coming defunding of government agencies responsible for predicting and 
            responding to natural disasters! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another implication is that the case for alternative monies and the rise of 
            asset classes like cryptocurrencies becomes not only far more predictable but 
            almost <b>inevitable</b> under the Neo-Monetarist physics of the economy. 
            The market begins to find other ways to process transactions more suitable 
            for exchanging different asset classes, especially across foreign 
            boundaries, which compose the majority of its mass. Digital coins might therefore 
            be predicted to become more useful to handle as the medium of transactions 
            than physical currency. How could the medium of account not, at a bare 
            minimum, be seen as some complex intersection of global currencies, given the impact 
            of multinational corporations‚Äîwhich operate using dozens of currencies at once‚Äîon nearly every 
            locality on Earth? Under this light, the U.S. stands to gain the most from the 
            proliferation of cryptocurrency around the world, as it allows actors around the 
            globe to more quickly move from their local exchanges into USD-denominated 
            accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, given the redefinition of what constitutes the supply of money, 
            perhaps the structure of theoretically predicted expected behavior by economic 
            agents more closely mimics the perception of economic hardship that consumers 
            have been feeling for years. I claim this misalignment lead, in large part, to 
            the Democrats' rebuttal, that the current structure of Monetarist economic thought 
            fails to encapsulate in its outdated measurements what provides the bread and butter 
            of everyday economic wealth stocks for the American people. Could this help to 
            provide the previously undefined phantom source for the so-called "Vibecession"?
        </p>
        <p>
            Financial assets are the money of the modern era, and Neo-Monetarism describes 
            the challenge of measuring that new complex of differently structured assets as 
            the key source of noise to control for in bringing the predictions of classic 
            Monetarism into the 21st century.

            I did not invent the concept of the cost-of-living crisis, but I do consider 
            myself uniquely positioned to connect the idea of the cost-of-living crisis to 
            the Vibecession to Monetarism as the source of misunderstandings of the structure of 
            economic hardship. These misunderstandings are misguiding policy and misguiding 
            the calculations of progressive forward-thinking policymakers today.

            Experts will tell you that the Biden administration guided the U.S. into a 
            position of global leadership in economic growth and inflation curtailment. As 
            many have pointed out, that very well may have registered in the economy, 
            leading to the defeat of the Democrats receiving the <i>unenviable</i> award of 
            "smallest rejection" of the year. But given the fundamentally different 
            structure of expectation propagation that Neo-Monetarism implies‚Äîrather than the 
            far more outdated model we're largely thinking within‚Äîwe begin to see the 
            importance of the crisis in home construction rates and austerity-inspired 
            individual fiscal tightening downstream from the dissolution of the welfare 
            state as more important than ever previously considered in determining what 
            people look to as the economic indicators that matter to them.

            The primary critique of monetary norms I've seen coming out of this is that 
            people <b>really</b> hate inflation, and the Federal Reserve needs to be even more 
            strict in curtailing inflation next time around. Small amounts of inflation are 
            hugely more electorally destabilizing than a few ticks of unemployment. I think 
            this may be partially true, maybe it's overemphasized because people haven't seen 
            real inflation for so long, but I also think it highlights how the indices we're measuring to 
            indicate the direction of money supply and velocity within the economy are 
            deeply flawed and blind to the realities of the financialized system Americans 
            rely on for the credit and asset accumulation that any and everyone 
            would tell you is the lifeblood of building personal financial success in the 
            21st century. Maybe the truth is that, as with most issues in Democratic turnout,
            the people are smelling the smoke coming from the disfunction in the system, 
            and this articulation is pointing out that that smoke is real and coming from 
            a real fire burning at the heart of our Post-Keynesian status quo!
        </p>
        <p>
            So, what is to be done?
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to build new houses, grease the lines of credit which the American 
            people rely on to make the types of long-term asset accumulation they depend upon, 
            and cut red tape to invest in the capital-intensive factories that fuel 
            financially cutting-edge industrial models like those of the tech industry 
            today.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aperture of results we need to be measuring within the economy to declare a 
            job well done needs to be widened to encompass all of the various capital 
            classes that make someone really feel like they're living in the vibrant society 
            of a global superpower. Otherwise, we will continue to see the American people 
            throw us out of office in favor of the person telling them that the experts 
            don't know what they're talking about and to give him sole power to "burn it all 
            down and build, baby, build."
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the vision I see of a productive narrative for a new American Dream, and 
            a significant portion of my answer to the question: What did we get wrong?
