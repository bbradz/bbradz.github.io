        <h3>Reading the Error Message</h3>

        <p>
            Four weeks ago, the American people went to the polls and voted to remove the Biden 
            administration, returning Donald Trump to the Oval Office and the position of 
            Commander in Chief. This has been the most consequential and upsetting election 
            result of my lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the wake of this disaster, the atmosphere feels markedly different from that 
            of 2016. Back then, fiery reactions of resistance and horror erupted from the 
            liberal masses. Now, however, I'm seeing a transformation within the liberal 
            intelligentsia‚Äîa shift toward depressive self-doubt. Vibrant democratic thought 
            withdraws into itself amidst it's defeat, healthily conceding it's rejection by 
            the American people in favor of the MAGA movement. There is an introspective 
            effort to grapple with the immense question of how to craft a constructive 
            narrative of the American dream that can reconcile the failures leading to this 
            man's reelection. We are witnessing sparks of a long-overdue intellectual 
            attempt to locate and dissolve the source behind liberal America's inability to 
            identify and address this repudiation of Bidenomics and the Democratic 
            coalition's agenda in its entirety, largely forced out by the democratic will.
        </p>
        <p>
            And I'm here to answer those questions :>
        </p>
        <p>
            Just kidding,,, üí¢‚ùóÔ∏è
        </p>
        <p>
            But I would like to discuss those questions a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amidst this tension, I feel that some of the strongest arguments explaining why 
            the Democrats were so thoroughly rejected boil down to issues of macroeconomic 
            reality. These arguments generally proceed as follows: A whipsaw of society 
            reopening after COVID-19, brittle globalized supply chains, and built-up consumer 
            savings gluts caused trillions of dollars to flood into a restricted supply pool. 
            This surge led to inflation spiking and price levels increasing by some 20 
            percent since 2020. Such unprecedented rises in price levels have inspired fury 
            among voters across the board in one of the most election-dense years in human 
            history. Universally, these voters have elected to throw out their ruling parties, 
            pointing the finger at them for real pain caused by these economic conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are important aspects that this narrative overlooks. The media environment 
            and the failure to conduct a proper presidential primary process are, in my mind, 
            the primary missing pieces. Nonetheless, I think the overall narrative is 
            correct‚Äîto a point.

            However, I don't believe this is solely about COVID-19. I think the pandemic was 
            the catalyst that revealed a cost-of-living crisis arising from an intersection 
            of failures within liberal institutions that have been left unaddressed for 
            quite some time now. The veneer of a decade-and-a-half-long, globalization-induced 
            zero-inflation landscape has been cast off. The American people are seeing the 
            direction in which society is moving in liberal America and have recognized the 
            need for change. I happen to agree, and I believe there are some compelling 
            reasons to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Liberal America is failing to understand economic reality, and I felt it would be 
            an interesting exercise to explore not only the mainstream theories of the 
            economy but also some of the more iconoclastic schools that have been gaining 
            traction outside the halls of academia.

        <h3>Stepping Through...</h3>

        <p>
            The very first theory of economics was Adam Smith's school of Classical Economics,
            also known as laissez-faire economics. Under this framework, markets were seen as 
            self-regulating through the invisible hand of self-interest, and government was 
            advised to take as minimal a role in the economy as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Classical Economics dominated academic thought up until the Great Depression, 
            which seemed to prove that free markets could, in fact, bring about truly deep 
            and prolonged dysfunction. Dynamics of extended mass unemployment and fears of 
            economic stagnation began to boil over. In response, the ideas of Keynesianism 
            rose alongside the guns of a big New Deal American government, which endorsed 
            and seemed to validate its ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the Keynesian School of Economics, it was argued that the government 
            should be the rational actor to smooth over the highs and lows of business 
            cycles. This meant supporting active government intervention in times of economic 
            breakdown and government saving in times of sustained economic growth. Keynesians 
            didn't necessarily argue against the long-term wisdom of the invisible hand of 
            the free market, but they rebuked it with the now-famous assertion that "in the 
            long run, we are all dead." They contended that the government cannot let people 
            live in squalor today for the sake of a not obviously forthcoming well-off future. 
            Short-run failures of the market needed to be righted to put the economy back on 
            track in the short term.
        </p>
        <p>
            The government, as an economic actor itself, could step in when aggregate demand 
            collapsed. As the sole holder of rights to print money, it could create money to 
            spend in the economy and bring economic activity back up to healthy levels. 
            Keynesianism aligned itself with a revision of Classical Economics known as 
            Neoclassical Economics, which incorporated new theoretical progress in rational 
            choice theory. This highlighted the importance of government in controlling 
            economic agents' expectations through policy posturing, which would influence 
            the state of things going forward and encourage differing views of the future 
            that impact current behavior. Together, Keynesian and Neoclassical tools of 
            supply and demand formed what is known as the Neoclassical Synthesis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, come the 1970s, in an America with the Great Depression far in 
            its rearview mirror, a new economic syndrome began to show its face‚Äîone which 
            Keynesianism proved unable to address. This spawned yet another new era of 
            economic thought: Monetarism, as well as a splinter faction in the form of the 
            Austrian School of Economics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Going into the 1970s, the U.S. government was already stimulating the economy 
            heavily due to poor rates of productivity increases. Then, OPEC‚Äîthe cartel of 
            oil-producing countries‚Äîembargoed the United States, causing inflation to 
            skyrocket. An inflationary cycle took place where workers demanded higher wages 
            to keep up with inflation, and in return, businesses passed the increased labor 
            costs onto consumers, creating a self-reinforcing spiral. Economic growth was 
            low, and inflation was high, directly challenging Keynesianism's call for 
            stimulus in times of inflation.
        </p>
        <p>
            To address this, the new Monetarist school rose with a theory centered around 
            the supply of money and an increased importance of the Federal Reserve in 
            regulating the national economy. Under the Monetarist framework, the money 
            supply was the unifying pool into which all levers of government fed to control 
            the economy. The Federal Reserve, as the sole institution empowered to print 
            U.S. dollars, became the most important economic actor in town‚Äîbeyond Congress, 
            which could force the Fed to print money for government spending.
        </p>

        <p>
            Monetarists maintained the theory of economic cycles from Keynesianism and built
            upon it, arguing that inflation is the product of the supply of money growing 
            faster than the bucket of real economic output being purchased with that money. 
            They described inflation mathematically under the formula:
        </p>
        <p>
            \( MV=PQ \), where \(M\) is the money supply, \(V\) is the velocity of money, \(P\) is the 
            price level, and \(Q\) is real output. Monetarists argued that the Federal Reserve 
            could reduce inflation through tools explicitly designed to decrease the amount 
            of money flowing through the economy.
        </p>
        <p>
            A natural rate of unemployment was defined, as well as a correlation between the
            money supply and the inflation consumers were experiencing. A new, strict 
            Federal Reserve chairmanship began under Paul Volcker, who subscribed to this 
            new Monetarist school. He spiked interest rates to cool down economic activity, 
            causing not only the recession of the early 1980s but also the successful 
            curtailment of the inflation spiral that the school had risen to address.
        </p>
        <p>
            Simultaneously, guided by desires to counteract the Cold War tendencies toward 
            central planning‚Äîwhich existed in the USSR at the time and were seen by many in 
            the Monetarist school‚Äîthe Austrian School of Economics grew. It described this 
            activist role of the Federal Reserve as the source of economic cycles of booms 
            and busts in the first place. The Austrian School took issue with the entire 
            project of Monetarism by arguing that its attempt to treat the money supply as 
            something controllable by government policy was an inherently flawed departure 
            from the tie that currency should have to the physical commodities to which they 
            had historically been pegged (such as the gold standard).
        </p>
        <p>
            Austrian Economics supported deregulation of the banking sector and minimalist 
            monetary intervention, describing business cycles as natural phenomena where 
            government intervention only serves to prolong economic problems that represent 
            the working through of market adjustments.

            This combined into the neoliberal equilibrium of Supply-Side Economics. While 
            the Federal Reserve would manage monetary policy‚Äîthe supply of money‚Äîthe rest 
            of the government was handling fiscal policy. Arguments began to dominate that 
            economic activity was being stymied by excessive taxation. Taxes were slashed‚Äîas 
            well as the social policies they funded‚Äîin favor of beliefs that businesses 
            would use the extra money to invest more in boosting economic output. A case in 
            point is the infamous Laffer Curve.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the point at which the modern rejections of economics as a field in its 
            entirety, which I see everywhere around me‚Äîboth at my university and among my 
            generation as a whole‚ÄîI believe owe their roots. But it wasn't until the 
            financial crisis of 2008 that these misunderstandings truly came to light.
        </p>
        <p>
            The financial crisis of 2008 highlighted that there was more to economic 
            collapse than mismanagement of the supply of money. Supply-Side Economics had 
            deregulated its way into a situation where a few systemically important banks 
            took on excessive internal leverage, engaged in risky lending, and indulged in 
            greed-fueled speculation to manufacture imaginary bubbles of economic growth 
            detached from reality and bound to eventually pop. Economic thought began to 
            understand that certain private organizations had grown to become "too big to 
            fail" and that neither the Monetarist school had the conceptual tools to tackle 
            the shortfalls of financial mismanagement nor could the Austrian method of 
            letting the free market fail be allowed to drag the global economy into its 
            greatest crisis since the Great Depression.
        </p>
        <p>
            Out of this grew entirely new fields of economics. One was Behavioral Economics, 
            which analyzed the psychological dynamics behind how humans act irrationally and 
            how that translates into unhealthy market equilibriums and financial bubbles. 
            Another was Post-Keynesian Theory, which built on Hyman Minsky's Financial 
            Instability Hypothesis to describe how stability breeds instability through 
            increased risk-taking in financial markets. This emphasized the role of 
            financial markets in influencing the supply of money as the source of credit 
            within the economy, essentially providing a synthesis of the Monetarist and 
            Austrian schools of thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            Post-Keynesianism subsumed Monetarism as the theoretical grounding for its 
            endogenous money supply while articulating new tools for measuring the 
            financial industry as a source of an exogenous money multiplier. In the decade 
            and a half after 2008, during which I was growing up, we saw a process of 
            globalization that caused wage growth to slow and prices to fall as supply 
            chains became more efficient. This efficiency was achieved by utilizing global 
            competitive advantages and economies of scale alongside digitalization, which 
            reduced costs across the economy through efficiencies and better information for 
            consumer goods. Aging demographics also slowed consumer spending.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            This translated into job loss and extremely low levels of inflation, which the 
            Federal Reserve managed through a 15-year regime of near-zero interest rates. 
            It wasn't until the storm of reopening after COVID-19‚Äîwhere globalized supply 
            chains proved far more difficult to logistically restart and trillions flowed 
            back into the market‚Äîthat the Federal Reserve actually had to pivot to 
            controlling inflation. While experts would tell you that they have largely done 
            a good job at this‚Äîwith inflation back down and unemployment actually below 
            what Monetarist underpinnings tell us it should be‚Äîpeople had also forgotten 
            what it feels like to see inflation and responded with fury.

            Much like in the 1980s and 2008, I see two main new schools of heterodox economic 
            thought that have been evolving under the surface of the current establishment 
            of economic theory. I don't necessarily agree with these theories‚Äîthe first one 
            I'll introduce I'm even fairly sure is very wrong‚Äîbut I think they're both 
            interesting as a way to dig into some of the freshest ground where issues are 
            being raised with the current way of doing economic thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first theory I would mention is <i>Modern Monetary Theory</i> (MMT). While Austrian 
            Economics critiqued the Monetarist school by arguing against the idea of 
            governments' ability to institute fiat currency‚Äîclaiming that the value of money 
            is based on the physical commodity to which it is tied‚ÄîModern Monetary Theory 
            builds on the chartalist view of money. Chartalism describes the value of money 
            as arising not from some pegging to a physical commodity of specific value but 
            instead from the exclusive right of the government to levy taxes on economic 
            activity. This legitimizes that country's currency as the exclusive medium for 
            valuing all of the economic activity within its borders.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chartalism shows its fingerprints in much of early economics, from Adam Smith 
            and Jean-Baptiste Say to John Stuart Mill and even Karl Marx. Today, MMT has 
            risen back to popularity largely as a justification for raising taxation to 
            fund government expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern Monetary Theory claims that the primary path to full employment is 
            through fiscal policy rather than monetary policy, which is the mainstream 
            narrative. It describes the federal government as breathing value into its 
            currency, where fiscal spending is limited solely by inflation that happens when 
            real resources are being fully utilized‚Äîthat is, near full employment. MMT rose 
            to prominence in the modern era through shout-outs by politicians like Bernie 
            Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It has played a role in delegitimizing 
            fears of taking on debt denominated in one's own government's currency, 
            promoting fiscal spending, and pushing for active federal programs to encourage 
            or directly provide employment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary critique of MMT lies in its overemphasis of the power of the 
            sovereign over its own currency‚Äîa point any foreign exchange trader will readily 
            discuss. Not only do the values of currencies move based on demand for that 
            currency in international transactions or because of central bank rate arbitrage 
            opportunities, but borrowers largely depend on the stable value of currency in 
            order to loan in that currency. Anti-MMT critiques argue that undercutting this 
            dynamic threatens credit issuance across the economy, which dampens overall 
            economic activity and investment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another critique of MMT is that it may be better to put non-elected officials in 
            charge of handling macroeconomic fluctuations rather than elected politicians, 
            who may be encouraged to overheat the economy to win short-term electoral 
            victories.
        </p>
        <p>
            This brings me to the second heterodox economic theory, about which I will be 
            writing much more and which I think is very much worth discussing: 
            <i>Neo-Monetarist Economics</i>.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            Neo-Monetarism grows out of the finance crowd and the economic ideas of Fisher 
            Black‚Äîone of the creators of the Black-Scholes model for financial markets 
            containing derivative investment instruments‚Äîand Eugene Fama, an expert on 
            modern portfolio management theory. Much like how Post-Keynesianism incorporated 
            financial markets as an exogenous supply outside the direct endogenous M2 money 
            supply, Neo-Monetarism claims that the "supply of money" needs to be reimagined. 
            It envisions the economy as fundamentally built on stocks of wealth‚Äîdifferently 
            liquid assets being traded around with, often, money as the intermediate step of 
            transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the eyes of Neo-Monetarists, while money is useful, the core driver of the 
            growth of stocks of wealth and the amount of credit being issued from those 
            stocks is the liquidity of a huge swath of asset classes with varying returns. 
            Thus, the supply of money becomes some measure of the size of the total assets 
            being traded, adjusted for the liquidity of each of those assets. Debt and 
            equity become not just additions and subtractions from the size of the economy 
            but, as beautifully shown in the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani‚ÄìMiller_theorem">>Modigliani‚ÄìMiller theorem</a>, 
            two differently structured classes of capital to value economic enterprises by.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this view, while the old theory of Monetarism based on cash supply used to 
            be quite correct, today liquidity is jointly produced by the Federal Reserve 
            and the private market‚Äîwith the private market mattering more and more as the 
            field of financial instruments grows.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus the growth rate of the economy becomes much harder to model as it depends 
            on the exercising of non-uniform embedded options markets, although some starter 
            concepts within Fed circles on how to account for this difference discuss 
            reformulating the growth rate formula from being expressed in terms of the 
            sheer sum of M2 money supply sources
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisia_monetary_aggregates_index#:~:text=That%20approach%20to%20monetary%20aggregation,aggregates%20or%20Monetary%20Services%20Indexes.">[1]</a>:

            \[
            \Delta M_t = \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{jt} - \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{j(t-1)}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            To the weighted sum of all of the different asset classes being traded across the 
            economy (weighted by liquidity aka usefulness as a medium of exchange):

            \[
            \Delta \log M_t^D = \sum_{j=1}^n s_{jt}^* \left( \log x_{jt} - \log x_{j,t-1} \right),
            \]
            where each asset class is weighted according to it's share of expenditures averaged over 
            two periods of change:
            \[
            s_{jt}^* = \frac{1}{2} \left( s_{jt} + s_{j,t-1} \right),
            \quad s_{jt} = \frac{\pi_{jt} x_{jt}}{\sum_{k=1}^n \pi_{kt} x_{kt}},
            \]
            and 
            \[
            \pi_{jt} = \frac{R_t - r_{jt}}{1 + R_t},
            \]
            with \(R_t\) as the benchmark yield and \(r_{jt}\) the yield of the \(j\)th asset. Thus 
            making \(\pi_{jt} \) the opportunity cost of holding a unit's worth of the \(r_{jt}\)th 
            asset.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core problem being pointed to here is that it's becoming more and more 
            difficult to identify what indeed even is the "money supply." A house, for 
            example, is pretty illiquid, but there's a chance you will borrow against your 
            house, meaning that there's some factor of liquid credit correlating to that 
            asset besides the sheer value of selling it. It's quite an open and technically 
            difficult problem to solve, but the point is to say that currency is not nearly 
            as influential as an asset pool in influencing the behavior of the market 
            compared to other asset classes. In fact, most of the supply of physical cash 
            isn't even inside the United States, meaning that the behavior of cash in 
            particular may depend more on behavior in foreign economies or even just in 
            illicit markets like the drug trade than on other more core asset classes, which 
            perhaps represent the lever of the American asset stock allocation and growth 
            much more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some levers could still be said to determine the money supply‚Äîmostly 
            expectations of future economic behavior based on business conditions, history, 
            and the Federal Reserve's posturing‚Äîbut also things like private liquidity and 
            international relations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hope is that by <b>redefining</b> the supply of money to be expansive, we could 
            then tease out a clearer signal of why it has been so hard to statistically 
            observe the relationship between the Fed's impression of the money supply and 
            the actual effects of their policies on economic behavior. Factors like the 
            success of the post-2008 Federal Reserve change to providing an interest rate on 
            bank reserves‚Äîaway from an explicit required amount of reserves‚Äîdrive the amount 
            of bank reserves from billions into trillions overnight. This shows the economy 
            ought to be viewed through the lens of assets rather than hard currency being 
            passed around between traders.
        </p>
        <p>
            One key policy takeaway of Neo-Monetarism is that the Federal Reserve is 
            actually far more underpowered than people currently understand it to be. The 
            role of banks as the sole source of lending by the Federal Reserve needs to be 
            abandoned. Viewed through the lens of who is providing liquidity in the market, 
            banks shrink to only around 20 percent of the whole asset stock, and the rest of 
            the economy‚Äîlike the insurance industry, where the crisis of 2008 really 
            started‚Äîbecomes far more important.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another implication is that the case for alternative monies and the rise of 
            asset classes like cryptocurrencies becomes not only far more predictable but 
            almost <b>inevitable</b>. The market begins to find other ways to process transactions 
            more suitable for exchanging different asset classes, especially across foreign 
            boundaries, which compose the majority of its mass. Digital coins might become 
            more useful to handle as the medium of transactions than physical currency. How 
            could the medium of account not, at a bare minimum, be seen as some complex 
            intersection of global currencies, given the impact of multinational 
            corporations‚Äîwhich operate using dozens of currencies at once‚Äîon nearly every 
            locality on Earth? Under this light, the U.S. stands to gain the most from the 
            proliferation of cryptocurrency around the world, as it allows actors around the 
            globe to more quickly move from their local exchanges into USD-denominated 
            accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, given the redefinition of what constitutes the supply of money, 
            perhaps the structure of theoretically predicted expected behavior by economic 
            agents more closely mimics the perception of economic hardship that consumers 
            have been feeling for years. This hardship led, in large part, to the Democrats' 
            rebuttal but which the current structure of Monetarist economic thought fails to 
            encapsulate in its outdated measurements of what provides the bread and butter 
            of everyday economic asset stocks for the American people. Could this help to 
            provide the previously undefined phantom source for the so-called "Vibecession"?
        </p>
        <p>
            Financial assets are the money of the modern era, and Neo-Monetarism describes 
            the challenge of measuring that new complex of differently structured assets as 
            the key source of noise to control for in bringing the predictions of classic 
            Monetarism into the 21st century.

        <p>
            I did not invent the concept of the cost-of-living crisis, but I do consider 
            myself the first person yet to connect the idea of the cost-of-living crisis to 
            the Vibecession and to the source of misunderstandings of the structure of 
            economic hardship. These misunderstandings are misguiding policy and misguiding 
            the calculations of progressive, forward-thinking policymakers today.

            Experts will tell you that the Biden administration guided the U.S. into a 
            position of global leadership in economic growth and inflation curtailment. As 
            many have pointed out, that very well may have registered in the economy, 
            leading to the defeat of the Democrats receiving the <i>unenviable</i> award of 
            "smallest rejection" of the year. But given the fundamentally different 
            structure of expectation propagation that Neo-Monetarism implies‚Äîrather than the 
            far more outdated model we're largely thinking within‚Äîwe begin to see the 
            importance of the crisis in home construction rates and austerity-inspired 
            individual fiscal tightening downstream from the dissolution of the welfare 
            state as more important than ever previously considered in determining what 
            people look to as the economic indicators that matter to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary critique of monetary norms that I've seen coming out of this is that 
            people <b>really</b> hate inflation, and the Federal Reserve needs to be even more 
            strict in curtailing inflation next time around. Small amounts of inflation are 
            hugely more electorally destabilizing than a few ticks of unemployment. I think 
            this is true, but I also think it highlights that the indices being measured to 
            indicate the direction of the money supply and velocity within the economy are 
            deeply flawed‚Äîblind to the realities of the financialized system which Americans 
            actually rely on for the credit and asset accumulation that any and everyone 
            would tell you is the lifeblood of building personal financial success in the 
            21st century.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, what is to be done?
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to build new houses, grease the lines of credit which the American 
            people rely on to make the type of long-term asset accumulation they depend upon, 
            and cut red tape to invest in the capital-intensive factories that fuel 
            financially cutting-edge industrial models like those of the tech industry 
            today.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aperture of results we need to be measuring within the economy to declare a 
            job well done needs to be widened to encompass all of the various capital 
            classes that make someone really feel like they're living in the vibrant society 
            of a global superpower. Otherwise, we will continue to see the American people 
            throw us out of office in favor of the person telling them that the experts 
            don't know what they're talking about and to give him sole power to "burn it all 
            down and build, baby, build."
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the vision I see of a productive narrative for a new American Dream, and 
            a significant portion of my answer to the question: What did we get wrong?
        </p>
