        <p>Look around you, actually look.</p>
        <p>
            One simple question: how much work do you think it took to make 
            everything within arms reach of you?
        </p>
        <p>
            From city-sized semiconductor fabs to GPT gpu clusters with more 
            compute power than global powers its impossible to imagine the scope 
            of energy needed to build and run the factories, machines, 
            transportation, information distribution system, and (lest we 
            forget‚Äî) workers that bring you the products you use and enjoy every 
            day. The modern industrial complex sprawls across oceans and 
            continents taking every form economically justifiable but, at the 
            end of the day, with enough abstraction it can be boiled down into 
            2 distinct ingredients: material to be molded and energy to do the 
            molding. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything anyone on Earth will materially every touch, want, and 
            need is produced by a chain of people using two things: resources 
            and energy. 
        </p>
        <p>~Matter and Motion~</p>
        <p>
            Maybe you like to turn to 
            <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1011492107">
            empirical observations on life satisfaction</a> and the globally 
            nearly presupposed capitalist growth imperative if <em>that</em> 
            appeals to you. Or turn to the 4+ billion people around the world 
            living on $6.85 or less in income every day for whom global material 
            abundance means the most. Regardless, if you personally want to live 
            in a world with more of the material things you use as well and 
            improved things you didn‚Äôt even think you needed then you should 
            care a lot about how good the very smart people who are making the 
            things you use are at taking advantage of Matter and Motion to make 
            the things you and all of us use.
        </p>
        <p>
            That‚Äôs where this article comes in. The recipe for material 
            well-being has two necessary inputs and I'd like to do a little
             deep dive into how the second part of that equation ‚ÄîMotion‚Äî is 
             undergoing a global revolution with every passing day. Plummeting 
             costs lead to surging capacities lead to the ability to utilize 
             exponential degrees of energy for molding the clay of the universe 
             into whatever forms we as humans and want to survive and thrive.

        <p>
            The key to understanding the energy abundance we‚Äôll be seeing more 
            and more is a little thing known as Wright‚Äôs Law which states the 
            more times a task has been performed the less time each subsequent 
            unit begins to take. Essentially, if you make a crazy number of 
            units you get crazily fast and efficient at making even more. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Wright‚Äôs Law is a verifiable component of unit-cost trends in all 
            sorts of industries having been discovered at NASA when they 
            observed consistent 15% reductions in costs per unit in Aerospace 
            components for every doubling of total units produced and comes down
            to a confluence factors. These include increased:

            Today we‚Äôre seeing the effects of Moore‚Äôs Law everywhere, we‚Äôve been 
            seeing a doubling in transistor densities and halving of compute 
            costs every 2 years for 60 years now.
        </p>
        <p>
            These dynamics are everywhere with most products falling between the 
            20 and 10 percent range in price for every doubling in scale and 
            Wind & Solar energy are no different. Rapid scaling in productive 
            capacity is beginning to plot a <em>Wright‚Äôs Law of Green Energy</em> 
            tracking how the scaling of Wind & Solar is reducing the cost of 
            renewables to astonishing degrees.

            Empirical observation from the past decade and a half of Solar 
            prices show that for every doubling in the cumulative amount of 
            global solar installations we‚Äôve seen a 30-40 (!) % decrease in

        </p>
        <p>
            The numbers work out so that we have enough room to double the

            transitioning the global energy production over to renewables, a 
            project which we‚Äôre already needing to do to prevent Climate 
            destruction. Utilizing that observed 30-40% learning rate energy 
            costs from new solar should begin to approach a single cent per kWh 
            by 2040, nearly 1/20 of the current going rate.

            leaving tons of room for continued scaling. Starting with the 2015

            has sufficient lithium-ion storage to hold 13 minutes of it‚Äôs yearly 
            electricity demand lithium-ion prices will have dropped by a factor

            The major issues with Solar and Wind are that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>They‚Äôre less efficient in some parts of the world</li>
            <li>They have a variable daily, even hourly, output</li>
            <li>They take up huge amounts of land</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Nuclear takes up <strong>very</strong> little land and runs 
            <strong>very</strong> consistently which makes it a perfect low 
            environmental impact option for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Places where solar and wind isn‚Äôt possible at scale like: 
                densely inhabited areas, small islands, or polar climates and‚Ä¶
            </li>
            <li>
                As baseline supply for when renewable sources dries up from 
                seasonal or weather fluctuations
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Modern nuclear reactors generally take up anywhere from 75 to 150 
            times less space than similar energy output solar farms (*including 
            the space needed for batteries) so nuclear can be really good option 
            depending on land availability or environmental issues with
            developing large swaths of land.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I don‚Äôt expect Nuclear to get as cheap as Solar can be because 
            of the tight regulations on building reactors which force costs 
            higher to pay off building costs, some regulations should almost 
            definitely be loosened on the <em>whether people who want to build 
            nuclear reactors are allowed to build them</em> front (as opposed to
            the <em>how tightly monitored those who are building nuclear 
            reactors are</em> front, which is probably good right now).

            But isn‚Äôt Nuclear power unsafe? No. Modern nuclear reactors 
            literally cannot melt down in the ways that Chernobyl or Fukushima 
            fell apart.

            Nuclear Fusion has also been plodding forward relentlessly for 
            decades and any decade now it will become economically feasible, at 
            that point Fusion will also become a great source for baseline 
            energy supply.
