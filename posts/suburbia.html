        <h1 id="A">Prologue</h1>

        <p>
            February 17th, 2022: As I sit typing away on my school-provided 
            MacBook the computer‚Äôs clock reads 12:57am and my mind, to be 
            completely honest with you, is absolute mush. Having been born and 
            raised in MA, I‚Äôve lived on the east coast my entire life but 
            ‚Äîthrough my interests in algorithms, CS, and the tech industry‚Äî 
            some way or another the Goliaths of San Francisco and Silicon Valley
            have always loomed over me. The city, somehow (!), casts its long 
            shadow of influence across every subject I touch but it wasn‚Äôt 
            until today that I finally got to see it with my own eyes. Setting 
            foot in what I could only ever describe as the holy lands of 
            innovation as me, my mom, and my younger sisters arrived here in SF
            at the bright and early time of ~9am (which necessitated leaving 
            home at the ~wonderful~ hour of 4am). 
        </p>
        <p>
            One would think, given the occasion, that maybe I‚Äôd be tied up in 
            scenic views of the Bay Area, or mesmerized by the vast perfectly 
            planted grids of almond trees forming oceans of white as far as the 
            eyes can see along our drive into Modesto (where I‚Äôm going to be 
            staying for the next couple of days to attend the celebration of 
            life of my late and great, grand-aunt, Shelly). But somehow for the 
            past 4 hours, after: 24 hours without sleep, 11 hours of travel, 
            1000+ miles travelled my crazy-ass mind has spent the last 3 hours 
            reading through ten different 2000+ word studies, blogs, and 
            think-tank pieces on Housing policy, Suburban sprawl, and the 
            benefits of Agglomeration. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It‚Äôs a delightful issue, and I truly <em>really</em> need to go to bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            I say all of this to bring you (the reader) into understanding where
            I‚Äôm at in writing this. Because what I‚Äôm going to elaborate on in 
            these next however-many-words-it-takes is, in my opinion, one of the 
            most important but under-covered facets of the dysfunction behind 
            the nature of life in modern America. Connected to the topic are 
            some of the most important ideas and topics which anyone genuinely 
            interested in improving this country needs to know (and many of 
            which I simply won‚Äôt have the time or resources to get into here). 
            To solve these issues would be a massive key to unlocking America 
            from the cage it has been building around itself for decades; 
            unleashing prosperity, longevity, and growth while setting the stage
            for an America of tomorrow orders of magnitude better than the 
            America of today.
        </p>
        <p>
            I‚Äôm pretty tired (this prologue took me 30 mins to write as I wafer 
            in bed), and this is a <strong>very</strong> important issue, so I‚Äôm 
            gonna get some rest and then we can dive in.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em><strong>ZZZZZzzzzzzz‚Ä¶..</strong></em>
        </p>
        <p>
            okay. let‚Äôs get started.
        </p>

        <h1 id="B">Why This is So Important:</h1>
        <p>
            <em>‚ÄúWe shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.‚Äù -Winston Churchill, 1943</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            I could open this up the way countless other‚Äôs have with a diatribe
            of anecdotes about growing up in car-dependent suburbia. I could 
            talk about the isolation of being separated from your friends by 
            miles upon miles of criss-crossing strips of killer concrete from a 
            young age. I could talk about how the physical layout of the world 
            we move through inevitably determines how we‚Äôre able to connect 
            with, experience, and enjoy the world around us. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm 
            interested in here. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I‚Äôm not going into the psychological implications (or roots) of 
            Suburbia. I‚Äôm most concerned with looking at Suburbia and American 
            housing from the perspective of public policy, of trying to really 
            break down the effect which the structure of how we live has on the 
            quantifiable outcomes of the society we‚Äôve built around it in hopes 
            of understanding where it can be improved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ever since the 
            <a href="https://benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/gibill_75.asp#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20VA%20Loan,loans%20totaling%20over%20%24161%20billion.">GI Bill of 1944</a> 
            which gave out almost 700,000 low-interest home loan totaling around 
            $164 billion (~$2.7 trillion today), America has been pursuing an 
            experiment never before seen in world history, that being the 
            physical manifestation of the individual liberty and freedom central 
            to the European and even more-so American mass ethos.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>**maybe I‚Äôll write about the history behind and issues with that 
            ethos again in the future more pointedly ü§∑</em>

            The Census finds that of the 140 million homes in the US around 
            <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-single-family-homes-are-there-in-the-US">95 million</a> 
            (or about 67.8%) are single-family. 3/4 of 
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html">
            all residential land in American cities is zoned exclusively for 
            detached single-family homes</a> with the same rate holding for the 
            entire state of 
            <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/single-family-zoning-san-francisco-bay-area">California</a>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            Important to note here is the uniquely American zoning tradition of 
            ~exclusivity~ where zoning starts off allowing for one thing 
            exclusively and can be allowed additional sanctioned activities with 
            local government permission. As opposed to countries like Japan and 
            Germany where zoning starts off as inclusive of all activities and 
            is narrowed down based off of what the national government decides.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the course of this article I‚Äôll try to outline how this 
            experiment is failing on almost every count, dumping numbers to show
             all the different ways that the drive towards Suburbia (pun 
             intended) is dragging down America and the world with it.

                the Boston Common. Millions struggle to fit into Boston, the 9th 
                most expensive city in the US, competing for limited housing while 
                Weston homeowners block any & all local development which could 
                threaten the wealth-generating personal fiefdoms they‚Äôve built just

            The American dream of a mansion for every man (albeit appealing to 
            the freedom loving, individually centered, rejection of Old World 
            norms which is the American psyche) is just that, a dream, and the 
            time has come to grow up as a country and understand that there are 
            things more important than living out the Victorian-era wet-dream of 
            lording over your very own country estate. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout all of human history from Baghdad to Rome, Constantinople
            to London, and even closer to my home in NYC, the ability to thrive 
            and prosper as a society historically has been tied to the positive 
            effects of doubling down on centralized, dense, community-oriented, 
            urban living. I argue that with the rise of the New Urbanist and 
            YIMBY movements advocating for more relaxed zoning rules and 
            allowing the building of new denser housing, now is the time for 
            this country to get over its childhood dreams of being able to live 
            the life of a rugged cowboy alone on their ranch and return to the 
            cities which made it all possible.

            The uniquely American and modern concoction of single-family housing 
            and car-dependent sprawl which is US Suburbia is killing (i) our 
            economy, (ii) our environments, and (iii) suffocating the American 
            people under the drape of utopian day-dreaming at a time when the 
            fate of our country, as well as the fate of democracy, liberalism, 
            freedom, and (not to be to fatalistic) humanity itself relies on its 
            success.

                Important Note: I won‚Äôt be touching on redlining b/c it‚Äôs external 
                to the economic perspective: optimizing growth w/ minimal effect on 
                the environment to grow the pie as much, and as sustainably, as 
                possible. <em>That being said</em>, it‚Äôs worth urging you to dig 
                into how Black America was shut out from the wealth generation of 
                Suburbia and left to rot. Come the fuck on America. Be better.

            Before we built our communities around the expectation of every 
            family having access to a car to get around they reflected a certain 
            natural and healthy balance. Homes and businesses were built close 
            enough together that even small town‚Äôs downtowns would have 
            everything you ever needed within a convenient walking distance in 
            exchange for a higher cost of living. Alternatively, those living 
            further away from downtown had worse access (although still being 
            within walking distance, because people still needed to buy food) 
            but could afford more space in a town‚Äôs lower-demand periphery. The 
            size of towns and how far people could live from them was inherently 
            constrained by how far someone could reasonably be expected to walk 
            which was not that far, ergo, promoting density.
        </p>
        <p>
            But with the introduction of cars, people and businesses were 
            suddenly able to move out of traditional town centers onto cheap 
            plots of previously rural/unoccupied land. Economically, individual 
            agents <strong>no longer have that financial incentive to stay 
            compact</strong> since as long as a road exists connecting 
            residential areas to commercial areas, it takes comparatively much 
            longer distances until commute issues to being to matter. This 
            <strong>incentivized the abandonment of urban centers</strong> in 
            favor of building spread-out neighborhoods and strip-malls on 
            previously cheap land, in the process making driving a 
            <strong>necessity to get around</strong> and causing societal 
            changes that can be seen everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let‚Äôs bust out the data and take a look at just how harmful that 
            process, and Suburbia, turned out to be:

        <h2 id="D">(i) Financially</h2>
        <p>
            First we need to understand that not only is Suburbia financially 
            unsustainable at a personal level but, crucially, it‚Äôs financially 
            catastrophic societally as well.

                    Despite <em>higher</em> costs for maintain servicing infrastructure, 
                    property taxes on lower-density housing results in <em>lower</em> 
                    effective taxes per acre on larger plots

        <p>
            One of the most important ideas here is that <strong>the cost to 
            maintain communities in low-density Suburbia is dramatically more 
            expensive than in more dense equivalents but generates significantly
            less money</strong> to actually pay for all of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It‚Äôs not hard to see why either, the more spread out home‚Äôs are, 
            <strong>by their very nature</strong>, the more (1) water pipes & 
            treatment centers, (2) electric lines, (3) internet wires, and 
            crucially (4) roads need to be built in order to get each of those 
            families the basic necessities they need.

            While <em>some</em> of this is unavoidable because of the spread-out 
            structure of where cities are located in the US and how vast of a 
            country it is, the issue goes beyond geography with the trend 
            continuing into urban cores as well. The 
            <a href="http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/">university of michigan</a> 
            found that nearly <strong>2/3rds</strong> of ground area in LA‚Äôs 
            central business district was dedicated to <strong>just roads and 
            parking spots</strong>, a trend which continues (albeit at different 
            rates) across all our cities (especially out West where almost all 
            growth took place after the adoption of cars).

            Suburban sprawl is extremely costly to the economy broadly. 
            Infrastructure and vital services like water &amp; energy are 
            <strong><a href="https://time.com/3031079/suburbs-will-die-sprawl/">
            2.5 times more expensive to deliver in the suburbs than in compact 
            urban centers</a></strong> and, in total, sprawl costs the U.S. 
            economy roughly <strong>$600 billion a year in direct costs</strong> 
            because of inefficient land usage and car dependency, and another 
            <strong>$400 billion in indirect costs</strong> from traffic 
            congestion, pollution, and the like, at least according to a 2015 
            study from the London School of Economics 
            <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-02/inside-the-new-suburban-crisis">(Bloomberg)</a>

            Malls, the bygone economic focal points of suburban Americas consumer 
            economy (although arguably a cheap knock-off of the active town 
            centers which they replaced) as well as the crucial 
            <strong>tax-bases</strong> of Suburbia, are shuttering their doors 
            now more than ever in American history 
            <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/22/malls-are-dying-only-these-ones-have-figured-out-secrets-success-internet-age/">(Washington Post)</a>-<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21561046/death-rebirth-department-stores-retail-charts">(Vox)</a> 
            because of vacancy rates as high as <strong>11.4% in Q1 of 2021</strong>

            alongside competition by the rise of eCommerce (eg. Amazon). 
        </p>
        <p>
            The bottom line is that Suburbia is <strong>financially impossible 
            to justify</strong>, and the American people and country 
            <strong>lose money</strong> on <strong>every</strong> new Suburban 
            development we <strong>build</strong> or even just <strong>continue 
            to utilize</strong>. A study by a Milwaukee suburb in 1992 found that 
            while a new single-family home will pay 
            <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suburban-Nation-Sprawl-Decline-American/dp/0865477507">less than $5,000 in taxes per year</a></strong> 
            it will cost its local governments nearly 
            <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suburban-Nation-Sprawl-Decline-American/dp/0865477507">$10,000 to service</a></strong>, 
            with newer estimates even more pessimistically finding that over the 
            course of their entire lifetime, Suburbs 
            <strong><a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme">pay only a FIFTH of their long-run infrastructure costs through taxes</a></strong> 
            leaving local governments saddled with footing the rest of the bill. 
            This ends out driving up public debt and 
            <strong><a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/10/poor-neighborhoods-make-the-best-investment">forcing inner cities to be taxed at higher rates just to keep those inefficient suburban outgrowths from going under</a></strong>.

            <strong>7 out of 8 Americans drive to commute in to work</strong> 
            and anyone who lives in Suburbia (or has seen it) knows why. These 
            communities are intentionally regularly built 10+ miles and 30+ 
            minutes from the places where they work (see chart above). All of 
            this means that getting around via car is sometimes, if you‚Äôre

            AAA estimated in 2021 that the <strong>total cost of car ownership 
            annually for the average American family is around $9,666</strong> 
            per year, almost <strong>1/3 of the ~$31,000 which the median American 
            earned</strong> in 2019, so it‚Äôs not hard to see just how quickly the 
            Suburban expectation for every family to get around by car eats up 
            family budgets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compare that to how the Chicago Transit Authority, for example, a 
            run-of-the-mill public transit system when it comes to major American 
            cities, costs <strong>around $1000</strong> per year to ride and you 
            begin to see just how much of a drain on the American economy car-dependency 
            can be. Even going off the cost of world-class public transit system 
            like The Tube over in London or the Subway in New York, costs are still 
            only <strong>$2400 and $2300 respectively</strong> around a quarter

        <p>
            And Cars aren‚Äôt even all of it, there are a huge amount of other 
            costs associated with the egregious sprawl of Suburbia which cost 
            Americans fortunes every year:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The cost to <strong>maintain those big sprawling grass lawn
                </strong>s (aka buying lawn-mowers, fertilizers, and pesticides 
                OR hiring lawn-mowers to do the job for you)?
                <ul><li>
                    Which amounts to <strong>$40 billion</strong> in Consumer

            <li>
                Home repairs?
                <ul><li>
                    The average American spent <strong>~$4,832 on home 
                    maintenance & emergencies in 2019</strong>
                </li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Extra Electricity costs from Electricity Fall-offs over the 
                distances it takes to get between Suburban homes
            </li>
            <li>
                Additional expenses from salting more roads & relying on a form 
                of transit which requires us to have roads to salt in the first 
                place.

        </ul>
        <p>
            TLDR;
        </p>
        <p>
            Suburban life and primarily being forced to own a car is a parasite 
            on the pocketbook of the American people, costing the avg. American 
            <strong>$7,500-10,000 on Transportation costs</strong>, <strong>$5,000 
            on Home Maintenance</strong>, <strong>$350 on lawn-care</strong>, and 
            likely <strong>$1,000s more on every other thing under the sun</strong>. 
            That‚Äôs a lot of mullah. <strong>$1.7-2 trillion nationally!</strong>

            Secondly, between CO2 Emission, Habitat Destruction, Biodiversity 
            Loss, Energy Efficiency, and Chemical Pollution, by almost every 
            metric out there Suburbs are increasingly the most polluting and 
            most unhealthy urban configurations out there at a time when we need 
            to be more environmentally conscious than ever.

            All too often those who prioritize the <strong>Green</strong> are at

            when it comes to the issue of Suburbia and Housing policy, 
            <strong>both sides can win</strong>. Movements like 
            <a href="https://degrowth.info/degrowth">Degrowth</a> have seen the 
            environmental destruction which came hand-in-hand with economic 
            growth for the past 80 years and made the apt point to slow economic 
            growth or even shrinking the economy for the sake of the environment 
            but abandoning the Suburban experiment could help to continue our

            <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-gdp-decoupling">decouple</a>
            economic growth from environmental damage</strong> allowing us to put 
            more and more money in the pockets of the American people and help 
            the environment at the same time. <strong>That</strong> is something 
            truly incredible.

            This is one of those <strong>golden goose</strong> opportunities 
            where we can both <strong>grow the economy</strong>, improving the 
            quality of life of everyone, while also <strong>nurturing nature</strong>, 
            cutting back our effect on the ecosystem(s) we rely on to survive. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While its important to understand the financial harm nationally and 
            individually of Suburbia in order to win a lot of people over and 
            get the changes we need, there are plenty of people out there for 
            whom the environmental side of things IS the important factor, and 
            for good reason. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So while money does talk, especially for those at ground-zero 
            struggling to make it by in the Suburban wasteland we‚Äôve built, lets 
            take a step away from that Economic lens to realize that the 
            Environmental side of Suburbia‚Äôs issues may be even more important 
            than the economic ones.

            When I was a kid horror movies didn‚Äôt mean movies where some masked 
            serial killer chases around some girl with a machete, no, the types 
            of movies which would really chill my bones and keep me up at night 
            were the movies about Climate disasters like <em>The Day After 
            Tomorrow</em>, <em>2012</em>, and <em>Into the Storm</em>. I think, 
            in part, because I knew that there was some truth to them. We need 
            to be taking steps right now to move our society away from relying 
            on the destruction of nature keeping us alive in order to function 
            and abandoning Suburbia and doubling down on high-density cities 
            instead would do that.

        <h4 id="H">(ii-a) Emissions:</h4>
        <p>
            Suburbs are <strong>inevitably</strong> by their <em>very structure</em> 
            the worst emitters of any type of living in the country, worse than 
            rural and urban living by far with one comprehensive 
            <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09640560802423780">study of New Jersey</a> 
            settlement patterns finding that as you ratchet up the density of 
            neighborhoods <strong>emissions follow an inverted ‚ÄúU‚Äù shape where 
            post-war suburbs ride high at the very pinnacle</strong> of emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is in part because Suburban homes are entirely detached from 
            each-other meaning that, in comparison to apartment buildings or 
            duplexes (or any other building holding more than one family at once), 
            <strong>every unit is exposed to the outside air on every side</strong> 
            meaning, <strong>from a pure physics standpoint, that there are up to 
            5 additional walls for heat to leak out through than in Apartment 
            buildings</strong> which forces more and more energy to be spent 
            heating and cooling homes, <strong>driving up the nearly 30% of 
            emissions which come from Electricity Generation</strong>.

            Transportation emissions, of which the vast majority is caused by 
            cars (stemming from the car-dependent nature of Suburbia) make up 
            <strong>30% of all the emissions</strong> in the US and since the 
            structure of low-density and spread-out Suburbia rules out any form 
            of travel other than cars, even more environmentally conscious 
            samaritans are <strong>forced to use cars</strong> instead of 
            biking, walking, or public transit, all of which are essentially 
            impossible in Suburban wastelands.</p>
        <p>
            And where are Americans supposed to park all those cars? Answer: In 
            a mindbogglingly large <strong>800 million to 3 billion parking spots
            </strong> (which works out to between 3 and 8 spots per car). Parking 
            spots which not only eat up land in the Suburbs but in the Inner 
            cities as well; gobbling up huge swaths of otherwise valuable land 
            with empty lots for storing empty cars in the 90% of time when they 
            aren‚Äôt being used. If all of those parking spots and roads, which make

            A 2012 study which looked at the US East of the Mississippi, where 
            Suburbs might even be expected to be growing slower than out West, 
            found that between 1992 and 2001 all urban areas combined expanded 
            by around 
            <strong><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-012-9766-8">30 square kilometers while suburban sprawl grew by more than 3000</a></strong>! 
            That‚Äôs important because it means that in order to build Suburbs you 
            need to chop down a lot more trees, clear a lot more wetlands, and 
            build over a lot more wilderness than if you were simply building

        <h2 id="K">Stepping back; The Broken Economics of Suburbia:</h2>
        <p>
            Essentially every single issue associated with Suburbia stems from 
            one Economic phenomenon, a phenomenon which we‚Äôve left untreated and 
            allowed to fester and grow for nearly 80 years now: 
            <em><strong>Externalities</strong></em>
        </p>
        <p>
            In Economics, Externalities are costs caused by an actor making a 
            decision where some of the negative effects of that decision aren‚Äôt 
            financially felt by the actor for making that decision (aka Having 
            your cake but not having to Eat it too).

            <li>
                <strong>The Cheapness of Ecosystem Destruction</strong>: 
                Developers aren‚Äôt taxed for the Ecosystems which they end out 
                paving over and destroying by building new houses. In fact, the 
                low cost of unoccupied land even goes as far as to 
                <strong>incentivize</strong> the building of new developments,

                    <strong>The Cheapness of Greenhouse Gas Emissions</strong>: 
                    While there <em>are</em> Gas Taxes which are used to fund road 
                    maintenance of a bit under 50¬¢ per gallon on average depending 
                    on the state, not only have these taxes been flat (aka falling 
                    because of inflation) since 1993, they‚Äôre <strong>nowhere near 
                    that of countries like Germany, Italy, and the UK</strong> 
                    where gas taxes are 
                    <strong><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/gas-taxes-in-europe-2020/">
                    nearly x6 higher (~$2.50-$3 per gallon)</a></strong>. We‚Äôve got 
                    absolutely NO Carbon Taxes, NO Energy Taxes, NO Nitrogen Oxide 
                    Taxes and all of it adds up to mean that there‚Äôs not only 
                    <strong>less money collected to maintain road</strong>s than 
                    in other those other countries, but that individuals and 
                    companies are given blank checks to drive around, running up 
                    their emissions and <strong>hurting everyone</strong>.

                    And, finally, <strong>The Cheapness to Degrade the Roads we 
                    drive on:</strong> Why do you think we have to maintain those 
                    roads in the first place? Sure, some of it is environmental 
                    but cars play an enormous part in it as well and drivers 
                    aren‚Äôt held accountable for it at all. Oh, and DON‚ÄôT come at 
                    me telling me that Gas Taxes are supposed to be covering that 
                    as well, do they help? Of course. But much more important in 
                    determining Road Degradation than <em>distance</em> driven 
                    is the <em>weight of the vehicle</em> being driven.

                <p>Let me introduce you to a little known relationship known as 
                    the <strong>Generalized Fourth Power Law</strong>. The 4th 
                    Power Law is the product of the 1961 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AASHO_Road_Test#:~:text=Unsurprisingly%2C%20the%20heavier%20vehicles%20reduced,%22%2C%20is%20derived%20from%20this.">AASHO Road Test</a> 
                    and determined that <strong>damage caused by vehicles is 
                    tied to the 4th power of their axle weight.</strong> Meaning 
                    that a 8,600 lbs Hummer (2,150 lbs per axle), in comparison 
                    to a 4 axle Prius weighing 3,050 lbs (750 lbs per axle), 
                    since it weighs roughly 2.87 times more, causes comparatively 
                    <strong>2.87^4 (aka 67.85 times) as much road degradation.</strong>

                    For a huge amount of reasons (which I don‚Äôt have the time or 
                    motivation to write about here) America, unlike Europe, is the 
                    home of superheavy Pickup Trucks and SUVs like the top-selling 
                    Ford F-150‚Äôs and Rav F-4‚Äôs, and while the <strong>average 
                    European car weighs 3,086 pounds, the average American one 
                    weighs nearly 1.32 times as much, a whopping 4,079 pounds.
                    </strong> That <strong>alone</strong> means that American cars 
                    cause 1.32^4 or <strong>3.04 times as much road degradation
                    </strong> as their European alternatives.

            The Externalities, produced by public policy failures, which have 
            undergirded and fueled the building of Suburbia are destroying our 
            economy, environment, and ultimately society. The time has come to 
            put an end to this madness.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>TLDR; Smartly Tax the ever-loving fuck out of Suburbia to 
            make it pay for the damage it‚Äôs causing.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            But if we‚Äôre gonna leave Suburbia behind were do we go instead? 
            Easy, we double down on the <strong>efficient high-density urban 
            environments</strong> we lived in for literally millenia before 
            Suburbia and which we see all around the Old World today, pushing 
            the American public <strong>away from car-based low-density Suburbia 
            into cities</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            While that‚Äôs absolutely what we should be doing, the supply of homes 
            in the inner cities is severely restricted as well by a huge swath 
            of serious issues with the way American cities function and until we 
            solve those are well American cities will continue to <strong>build 
            outward, forming the Suburbs</strong> we see today, <strong>rather 
            than develop dense vertically-developed urban cores</strong> which 
            you see in the great cities of yester-year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Have you ever wondered why LA and SF never developed the expansive 
            denser urban centers of Tokyo, Shanghai, New York, London, and Paris?

        <h2 id="N">A backbreaking undersupply of Housing</h2>
        <p>
            In order to shift away from Suburban life towards restoring our 
            high-density Urban cores to their past glory we need to take a look 
            at some of the issues in those Urban cores which are causing American 
            cities to be forced to build those Suburbs in the first place. A 
            line of questioning which essentially universally leads back to the 
            irrefutable fact that <strong>cities are refusing to build the new 
            housing needed to accommodate the American public</strong>.

            There‚Äôs a <strong>shortage</strong> <strong>of homes</strong> from 
            coast to coast the scale of which we‚Äôve never seen before in the 
            United States, especially concentrated in cities like <strong>New 
            York, SF, Boston, Miami, DC, LA, Seattle,</strong> and <strong>San 
            Jose</strong> a housing shortage which is spilling over and spreading 
            into more and more auxiliary cities with every passing month.
        </p>
        <p>
            Putting some numbers to that, the Public Policy Institute of California 
            analyzed data from the 2020 US Census and 
            <a href="https://www.ppic.org/blog/new-housing-fails-to-make-up-for-decades-of-undersupply/?utm_source=ppic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=blog_subscriber">found</a> 
            that over the last 10 years <strong>California added 3.2 times more 
            people than it did housing units</strong>, causing there to currently 
            be <strong>2.93 Californians for every occupied housing unit</strong>. 
            And although coastal housing is the most expensive, the biggest 
            percent change in housing undersupply has actually occurred in 
            <strong>inland regions</strong> where, to avoid higher coastal 
            prices, many people moved to the Central Valley, east of the Bay Area, 
            and the Inland Empire east of Los Angeles. In the process, they have 
            driven up prices in their new neighborhoods as well.

            The Legislative Analyst‚Äôs Office found in 2015 that over a 30-year

            70,000 more units each year</strong> and perhaps as many as <strong>
            110,000</strong>. Adding up to a <strong>shortfall of about 3.5

            <strong>Rent is soaring.</strong> The price of homes in SF is higher 
            now, even adjusted for inflation, than it was at the peak of the dot 
            com bubble causing the city to get so prohibitively expensive at 
            this point that even someone making $100K per year could now find it 
            difficult to pay for the cost of living. It‚Äôs to the point where not 
            only are our countries largest cities seeing 
            <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/30/rent-inflation-housing/">>30% rises in rent YOY</a>
            </strong> but that 11 million households, or <strong>1 in 4 
            renters</strong>, are spending more than half of their monthly income 
            on their rent‚Ä¶ although experts say that figure is <strong>likely 
            even higher now</strong> (Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies).
        </p>
        <p>
            Even worse, those who traditionally lived in these cities before 
            these housing shortages who can‚Äôt afford the soaring costs of living
            are increasingly finding it impossible to put a roof over their heads, 
            leading to nearly 
            <strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2021/04/16/the-us-cities-with-the-highest-homeless-populations-in-2020-infographic/">580,000 Homeless</a></strong>

            nationwide concentrated on the streets of these major cities and 
            major <strong>gentrification</strong> of their once culturally 
            vibrant and deep-knit communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            But let‚Äôs for the sake of argument throw that all out the window and 
            disregard how this housing shortage is hurting the lives of 10s of 
            millions of Americans particularly those who it leaves on the street to 
            die and the disproportionately minority communities which it breaks 
            apart. We would still need to understand that this housing shortage 
            is <strong>holding back the entire US and wider world</strong> (yes, 
            through promoting Suburbia but also‚Ä¶) by driving a spear into the 
            heart of the innovative clusters of talent that produce the <strong>
            inventions</strong>, <strong>ideas</strong>, and ultimately <strong>
            growth</strong> which we as a country rely on in order to thrive and 
            prosper.

        <h3 id="P">We Need Strong Cities.</h3>
        <p>
            Academics of all types from Economists to Urbanists all love to talk 
            about the importance of the clustered networks of individuals and 
            firms working and living together in a shared environment which 
            generates the tech clusters we see in major cities like SF, NY, Boston, 
            Seattle, and LA. The reason being that, all else equal, (as a matter 
            of 1,000s of years worth of empirical fact) having more smart people 
            interacting as much as possible leads to <strong>more ideas</strong> 
            which leads to <strong>more innovation</strong> which leads to 
            <strong>more growth</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            These <strong>agglomeration effects</strong> as Economists call them 
            occur in cities all across the world and are really the fundamental 
            reason why things like <strong>Cities</strong>, <strong>Universities
            </strong>, and <strong>Corporate</strong> <strong>HQs</strong> exist 
            in the first place. One tremendous advantage which the US enjoys is 
            the unique geopolitical advantage of having the premier industrial 
            clusters for essential technologies like <strong>software development
            </strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> which will shape the
            paths of <strong>billions</strong> <strong>of lives</strong> and 
            <strong>trillions</strong> <strong>of dollars worth of economic 
            activity</strong> for decades to come.

            In the 1800s, Lowell, Massachusetts was the center for textile mills 
            relying on water power. By the early 1900s, Cleveland was pushing 
            forward the frontier of electricity and steel. Later Detroit and Michigan, 
            of course, developed into the powerhouse for automobile manufacturing 
            in the mid-1900s. And now, American tech clusters are the envy of 
            the world. Of the <strong>four</strong> Trillion-dollar companies in 
            the world, <strong>two</strong> are based near <strong>San Francisco 
            (Apple and Alphabet)</strong>, and <strong>two</strong> near <strong>
            Seattle (Amazon and Microsoft)</strong> with <strong>14 of the top 
            30 Internet firms being based in SF alone</strong>.

            The effects that tech clusters have on innovation and productivity 
            growth are extremely impressive and well understood, even on the 
            individual level with 
            <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26270">studies finding</a> 
            that: ‚Äúa computer scientist moving from a median-sized cluster in CS

            <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26270"><strong>12.0% increase in productivity</strong></a>. 
            This trend continues outside of CS too with workers a move by

            and <strong>as clusters get larger and more specialized</strong>, 
            the <strong>productivity boosts also get larger</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Larger and larger tech clusters lead to disproportionately larger 
            gains in economic activity, high-skilled technical employment levels, 
            the number of patents granted, and R&D funding to bankroll 
            innovation. They‚Äôre were the most interesting conversations and

            Which, if anything, shows even more why the housing crisis in these 
            countries is so alarming. Because of that housing shortage, 
            up-and-coming innovators are forced to pay 
            <strong><a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/clusters-rule-everything-around-me/">3x the national average</a></strong> 
            in rent in order to live in places like Silicon Valley or Manhattan.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Q">The True Cost‚Ä¶</h3>
        <p>
            Those <strong>aggregate costs of the misallocation of labor</strong> 
            being <strong>pushed away from tech clusters by the high costs of 
            living</strong>, means that workforce size <strong>hasn‚Äôt been able 
            to grow in tandem with its productivity</strong> causing <strong>
            fewer workers to benefit from that increased productivity</strong> 
            and preventing both individual cities and the country as a whole 
            from maximizing economic potential. A 2009 joint study out of the 
            University of Berkeley and University of Chicago places the aggregate 
            cost of that lower worker-productivity at having 
            <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21154/w21154.pdf"><strong>slashed US GDP Growth between 1964 to 2009 by</strong><strong>50%</strong></a>,

            <strong>TLDR; It‚Äôs driving up rents. It‚Äôs driving up homeless rates.

            communities. It‚Äôs driving down productivity. It‚Äôs costing us 
            trillions.**</strong>
        </p>
        <h3 id="R">How to fix it:</h3>
        <p>
            I. <strong>Build more housing!</strong> Studies show that building 
            literally any type of housing from 
            <a href="https://appam.confex.com/appam/2018/webprogram/Paper25811.html">luxury</a> 
            to 
            <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/7fc2bf_ee1737c3c9d4468881bf1434814a6f8f.pdf">market-rate</a>

            <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-singapore-plan-for-public-housing?utm_source=url">affordable housing</a> 
            brings down the cost of rent for everyone from the richest to the 
            poorest residents because increasing supply of housing, *surprise 
            surprise*, brings down the cost of housing.
        </p>
        <p>
            II. <strong>Reform local housing regulations!</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Abolish Single-family Zoning which artificially limit supply, or 
                better yet reform the zoning the American zoning code away from 
                one of implicit restriction where you need to fight for new legal 
                usages to one of default inclusion (like Japan) where we start 
                from the presumption of all land uses being okay and scale back 
                uses as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Abolish parking minimums which force lots to spend more time 
                accommodating cars and less time accommodating the people meant 
                to live on them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Abolish minimum lot size restrictions which subsidize large 
                truck ownership and car ownership more generally at the expense 
                of everyone else.
            </li>
            <li>
                Abolish the discretionary review process for multi-family 
                housing which keeps any new housing developments stuck behind so 
                much red tape that they never see the light of day
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            III. <strong>Better yet, shift land-use decisions from the local 
            level to the federal or state level!</strong> Housing is managed at 
            a national level in the UK, Japan, and Singapore largely because the 
            interest of the politically involved residents of a neighborhood 
            (who, by the way, are 
            <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/8/27/who-is-the-public-at-public-meetings">almost exclusively homeowners</a> 
            who stand to profit from restricted housing supply and higher home 
            prices) often isn‚Äôt in the interests of the general public.

        <h2 id="T">[+] Addendum : Why We Can‚Äôt Build</h2>
        <p>March 29th, 2023</p>
        <p>
            This entire post could be, curtly, summarized as: complaining about 
            why too many <em>low</em> density places are being built and too 
            little <em>high</em> density places are being built. One of the 
            things I really tried to underscore throughout the article was the 
            concrete policy failures which could be righted to help fight and 
            reverse the status-quo we‚Äôve built ourselves into today. Well, I 
            think I‚Äôve got a couple semi-different critiques worth mentioning 
            that warrant this addendum.
        </p>
        <p>
            I generally focused a lot of my effort in the above pages on 
            explaining the <em>fiscal policy</em> failings causing these density 
            issues, and I‚Äôm relatively happy with the detail I gave to that side 
            of things. However: fiscal policy isn‚Äôt everything and in this past 
            1 year and 1 month I‚Äôve picked up another new policy to point to as 
            a, I believe, important brick in the wall preventing America from 
            unlocking its true potential for productive genuine density.

            Turning to the field of <em>regulatory policy</em>, I would point a 
            heavy hand at NEPA (the National Environmental Policy Act) as a 
            massive piece in the puzzle of understanding why this country is so 
            simply unable to build.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am really not the type of person to take issue with regulations 
            usually, one of the most important tasks government is uniquely 
            saddled with is the regulation of society to protect everyone from 
            private sector abuses which will hurt all of us. However, NEPA is 
            different and it‚Äôs actually a really interesting deep dive to go 
            about figuring exactly why.
        </p>
        <p>
            To explain it overly quickly, the core flaw of NEPA is that it 
            introduces too many veto powers for individuals to halt developments 
            in their tracks at extremely low costs for extremely long periods of 
            time, effectively delaying projects until the will dies.
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice, NEPA is a 70s era monster responsible for regulating 
            how the government is required to evaluate the environmental impacts 
            of the projects it launches before it‚Äôs properly allowed to break 
            ground and begin construction. NEPA outlines 3 different levels of 
            review: categorical exclusion (easiest), an environmental assessment 
            (mid), and an environmental impact statement (hardest). 
        </p>

        <p>
            NEPA enforcement is done through the courts with political action 
            groups going to judges (who are often very willing to entertain 
            their concerns out of a sense of misplaced caution) with nearly any 
            complaint about the government having overlooked any of the 
            environmental effects of their projects being able to stop all 
            construction indefinitely until the concerns brought up are fully 
            researched and alleviated if found.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this, in theory, sounds like an okay system the issue comes 
            from the vague wording of the law around what ‚Äúenvironmental 
            effects‚Äù legally means and a vibes-based set of legal customs and 
            precedents which have made NEPA easier and easier to abuse over 
            time. NEPA gives anyone with a lawyer the power to nullify the plans 
            for any project if they can just repeatedly find new and 
            decreasingly relevant nitpicking issues which that project simply 
            ~may~ with more research end up being capable of causing.

            From Berkeley landowners delaying the building of housing by describing 
            <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-03-02/california-uc-berkeley-ceqa-housing-environment">

            (at the small scale), 3.5-7.2 year delays for Forest Fire Services

            rail expansion (a project crucial for reducing overall emissions 
            from transportation‚Ä¶) the same story keeps happening. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A $2.6 billion offshore wind project close to my home, in Cape Cod, 
            was cancelled after nearly 16 years of legal dogfighting over effects 
            to the local fish populations and a $3 billion wind project in 
            Wyoming took 11 years to finish review because of NEPA related 
            legal quarrels. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to build in order to more sustainably restructure the 
            physical layout of our nations neighborhoods. We need new clean 
            energy infrastructure. We need modern infrastructure fit for a modern 
            world and modern economic needs. NEPA locks all of those behind the 
            need for near perfect unison on every possible implication of a 
            project before it can become, and multiplied across the entire 
            country that translates into a chilling effect on American‚Äôs 
            understanding of what we can actually get done with the resources we 
            have if we just allow them to go to work for us on real projects 
            with real tangible benefits instead of decade+ review processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is just an addendum, so I‚Äôm not going to go into extreme detail 
            about this policy but let it be said here that another very important 
            policy that I would push for redesigning would be the overly 
            restrictive NEPA regime locking away developments all around the 
            country.
