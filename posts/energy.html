        <p>Look around you, actually look.</p>
        <p>
          One simple question: how much work do you think it took to make
          everything within arms reach of you?
        </p>
        <p>
          From city-sized semiconductor fabs to GPT gpu clusters with more
          compute power than global powers its impossible to imagine the scope
          of energy needed to build and run the factories, machines,
          transportation, information distribution system, and (lest we
          forget‚Äî) workers that bring you the products you use and enjoy every
          day. The modern industrial complex sprawls across oceans and
          continents taking every form economically justifiable but, at the
          end of the day, with enough abstraction it can be boiled down into
          2 distinct ingredients: material to be molded and energy to do the
          molding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything anyone on Earth will materially every touch, want, and
          need is produced by a chain of people using two things: resources
          and energy.

          Maybe you like to turn to
          <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1011492107"
            >empirical observations on life satisfaction</a
          >
          and the globally nearly presupposed capitalist growth imperative if
          <em>that</em> appeals to you. Or turn to the 4+ billion people around
          the world living on $6.85 or less in income every day for whom
          global material abundance means the most. Regardless, if you
          personally want to live in a world with more of the material things
          you use as well and improved things you didn‚Äôt even think you needed
          then you should care a lot about how good the very smart people who
          are making the things you use are at taking advantage of Matter and
          Motion to make the things you and all of us use.

        <p>
          That‚Äôs where this article comes in. The recipe for material
          well-being has two necessary inputs and I'd like to do a little
          deep dive into how the second part of that equation ‚ÄîMotion‚Äî is
          undergoing a global revolution with every passing day. Plummeting
          costs lead to surging capacities lead to the ability to utilize
          exponential degrees of energy for molding the clay of the universe
          into whatever forms we as humans and want to survive and thrive.

        <p>
          The key to understanding the energy abundance we‚Äôll be seeing more
          and more is a little thing known as Wright‚Äôs Law which states the
          more times a task has been performed the less time each subsequent
          unit begins to take. Essentially, if you make a crazy number of
          units you get crazily fast and efficient at making even more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wright‚Äôs Law is a verifiable component of unit-cost trends in all
          sorts of industries having been discovered at NASA when they
          observed consistent 15% reductions in costs per unit in Aerospace
          components for every doubling of total units produced and comes down
          to a confluence factors. These include increased:

          costs every 2 years for 60 years now.
        </p>
        <p>
          These dynamics are everywhere with most products falling between the
          20 and 10 percent range in price for every doubling in scale and
          Wind &amp; Solar energy are no different. Rapid scaling in productive
          capacity is beginning to plot a
          <em>Wright‚Äôs Law of Green Energy</em>

          Wind &amp; Solar come to rule grid production?
        </p>
        <p>
          The numbers work out so that we have enough room to double the
          cumulative quantity of solar 5 times over in the process of
          transitioning the global energy production over to renewables, a
          project which we‚Äôre already needing to do to prevent Climate
          destruction. Utilizing that observed 30-40% learning rate energy
          costs from new solar should begin to approach a single cent per kWh
          by 2040, nearly 1/20 of the current going rate.

          All of the large lithium-ion batteries in 2015 combined stored the
          equivalent of less than a minute of global electricity demand
          leaving tons of room for continued scaling. Starting with the 2015
          price of batteries, around 25 cents per kWh, by the time the planet
          has sufficient lithium-ion storage to hold 13 minutes of it‚Äôs yearly
          electricity demand lithium-ion prices will have dropped by a factor
          of 2 to 2.5 or 10-13 cents per kWh.

          increasingly efficient is key in unlocking the electrification of
          parts of the global economy currently locked into emitting CO2 by
          the limitations of the batteries we‚Äôre stuck with today.
          Transportation makes up nearly
          <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-transport"
            >1/5 of global CO2 emissions</a
          >
          and while we‚Äôve already began electrifying cars and are making real
          progress on trucking,

          and aviation both need the resources and attention of a
          tremendously scaled battery industry in order to have the resources
          to make battery innovations which make electric boats and planes
          possible.

        </h2>
        <p>
          I mentioned earlier how one of the primary issues with the nature of
          solar (and wind) energy is that it ebbs and flows based on weather,
          time of the day, and time of year. Well, while I‚Äôm generally all-in
          on government subsidies being funneled into Solar, Wind, and Battery
          technology the biggest potential sources for cheap energy abundance,
          there‚Äôs a good conversation to be had about the indispensability of
          nuclear as a baseline energy provider where renewables fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The major issues with Solar and Wind are that:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>They‚Äôre less efficient in some parts of the world</li>
          <li>They have a variable daily, even hourly, output</li>
          <li>They take up huge amounts of land</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Nuclear takes up <strong>very</strong> little land and runs
          <strong>very</strong> consistently which makes it a perfect low
          environmental impact option for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Places where solar and wind isn‚Äôt possible at scale like:
            densely inhabited areas, small islands, or polar climates and‚Ä¶
          </li>
          <li>
            As baseline supply for when renewable sources dries up from
            seasonal or weather fluctuations
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Modern nuclear reactors generally take up anywhere from 75 to 150
          times less space than similar energy output solar farms (*including
          the space needed for batteries) so nuclear can be really good option
          depending on land availability or environmental issues with
          developing large swaths of land.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I don‚Äôt expect Nuclear to get as cheap as Solar can be because
          of the tight regulations on building reactors which force costs
          higher to pay off building costs, some regulations should almost
          definitely be loosened on the <em>whether people who want to build
          nuclear reactors are allowed to build them</em> front (as opposed to
          the <em>how tightly monitored those who are building nuclear
          reactors are</em> front, which is probably good right now).
        </p>

        <p>
          But isn‚Äôt Nuclear power unsafe? No. Modern nuclear reactors
          literally cannot melt down in the ways that Chernobyl or Fukushima
          fell apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nuclear Fusion has also been plodding forward relentlessly for
          decades and any decade now it will become economically feasible, at
          that point Fusion will also become a great source for baseline
          energy supply.
